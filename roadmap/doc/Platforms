RoadMap Platform Specifics

November 2008


= Platform Specific Information =

The generic instructions and information given elsewhere are appropriate
for most "standard" linux desktop machines, but some handheld and "special"
devices have slightly specific requirements.  These are described here.


== Windows CE Support ==

  - Dependencies and Limitations

     The initial port to Windows was implemented by Ehud Shabtai.

     RoadMap is currently only available for Windows CE (PocketPC, Windows
     Mobile).  There is no support for desktop Windows (XP, Vista, ..) -- the
     WIN32 API is not the same on all Windows platforms.

     RoadMap uses the WIN32 API exclusively, no specific graphic library
     is required.

     There is UNIX Makefile support for building the WinCE version of
     RoadMap using the arm-mingw32ce cross-compiler toolchain,
     available from http://cegcc.sourceforge.net .

     Maps cannot be built under Windows (buildmap and buildus have not been
     ported yet).  Maps built under Linux can be used on PocketPC systems.

     The flite software is available under Windows: a PocketPC 2002 (ARM)
     binary is available on the RoadMap project's SourceForge web site. The
     flite.exe binary must be installed in the same folder as the roadmap.exe
     binary.

     The gpsd software is not available on Windows.  Note that network access
     to a remote gpsd is possible (the remote computer must run UNIX).

     Instead of a local gpsd, RoadMap can uses a Windows serial port and the
     GPS source should then be specified as "COM1:", "COM2":, etc...
     Bluetooth devices are also known to work (over a virtual serial port).

     Only NMEA-capable GPS devices are supported, unless a remote gpsd is
     used.

     Features not available on Windows :

     - Downloading maps on the fly

     - The screenshots feature

     - The full-screen mode of RoadMap

     - The ~ and & shortcuts used when specifying pathnames.


  - Configuration Files

    Windows CE based computers are usually of the PDA type, so we make it
    possible to install all RoadMap files in a memory card.

    The configuration directories on Windows CE are:

           + \Program Files\roadmap
           + \Storage Card\roadmap (preferred path)
           +

    As Windows CE does not really have the concept of a user directory,
    RoadMap will automatically add to the list the directory holding the
    RoadMap executable.

    The default name of a memory card on your Windows CE device is extracted and
    automatically supported by RoadMap.  In that case, replace \storage card\..
    in the example above by e.g. \SD Card\.. .

  - Installing maps

    On Windows CE the default map search path is:

           + \Program Files\roadmap\maps
           + \Storage Card\roadmap\maps (preferred path)


== OLPC XO Laptop Support ==

The XO laptop, created by the One Laptop per Child project, has a
large high resolution (900x1200) sunlight-readable screen, making
it attractive for use with RoadMap.

If the XO is running a "standard" linux distribution (Debian, Ubuntu,
and Fedora are all available) then RoadMap installs just as it does
on any other linux.  But if the laptop is running the OLPC "Sugar"
system, then RoadMap must be packaged as a Sugar "activity", which
adds some extra requirements to its environment.

A pre-built copy of RoadMap.xo is available at the OLPC Activities 
page:

            http://wiki.laptop.org/go/RoadMap 

If that copy is inappropriate or unavailable, you can build your own.

  - Building the RoadMap.xo activity

    Start with a relatively clean copy of the RoadMap source tree from CVS
    (not the tarball), and change directory to "sugar", at the top-level of
    the tree.  From there, simply run the script "mk_activity" -- this will
    build an appropriately-configured copy of RoadMap, and adds the system
    and user config to the the .zip-formatted archive that OLPC calls a
    ".xo" bundle.  Just a few maps may be added to that bundle if you have
    your maps installed in /usr/local/share/roadmap/maps -- otherwise no
    maps will be provided.

  - Installing maps

    RoadMap will look for maps in a directory called
    "RoadMap.maps" on any external media (SD or USB) that's
    mounted in the standard /media/NAME location on the XO. 

    The default Map.Path on the XO is:
         + SUGAR_BUNDLE_PATH/maps (i.e. below the installation directory)
         + SUGAR_BUNDLE_PATH/maps/??
         + /media/*/RoadMap.maps
         + /media/*/RoadMap.maps/??


== iPhone/iPod Support ==

The iPhone/iPod touch support is preliminary as of yet, but it is usable in
the current state.  Initial iPhone support (as well as this README) was
provided by Morten Bek.

  - Official vs. unofficial SDK:

       The official iPhone sdk is not used for the iPhone port.  Since a
       GPS was added to the iPhone 3G, Apple has added a clause to the
       license agreement that prohibits developers from making car
       navigation applications using the official SDK.

       Other than this clause, one must sign an NDA when downloading the
       SDK, so effectively GPL'ed software can't be built using the SDK
       since publishing the source is a violation the NDA.

       Many people were hoping that once the iPhone 2.0 firmware was
       released, the NDA would be lifted and the port could be modified to
       work with the official SDK, but I guess that this new clause
       effectively ends that hope...  Oh well, long live the unofficial SDK
       and jailbroken iPhones...  :-)

  - Compiling

       The iPhone binaries should be compiled using the unofficial iPhone
       toolchain (http://code.google.com/p/iphone-dev/wiki/Building). 
       It should be possible to get the toolchain up and running on both
       OSX, Linux and MS Windows.  In config.mk set the DESKTOP to iphone
       and optionally use some of the example options for setting CROSS,
       CFLAGS, etc.  If you use the example options your binaries will be
       placed in

```
       /tmp/Applications/RoadMap.app
```

       The binaries will have references to
```
       /Application/RoadMap.app/resources
```
       so be sure to install in that location - or change your settings
       accordingly.

       The program compiles nicely with expat.  Just download the latest
       version of expat and do a ./configure using the paths to your
       toolchain binaries.  I haven't got dynamic linking to work, so
       instead I copy expat/.libs/expat.a to the roadmap/src directory -
       run the toolchain version of ranlib on the binary and then link with
       that library statically.

  - Installation

       If you use the example options, simply use:
```
       scp -r /tmp/Applications/RoadMap.app root@your.iphone.ip:/Applications
```
       Notice that roadmap installs many additional binaries in
       RoadMap.app/bin.  These are not needed for RoadMap to operate, but
       you may play around with them on the phone or delete them before
       copying the folder to the phone.

       Maps need to be placed in
```
       /Applications/RoadMap.app/resources/maps
```
       Maps are in a binary format and sometimes need to be converted to or
       built on the device on which they will be used.  However, maps built
       on i386 linux are compatible with the iPhone.

  - Known Issues

       - No menu support
       - Only preliminary toolbar support
       - No keyboard shortcuts (hard without a keyboard! :-)
       - No advanced dialog support (although messageboxes do work)
       - Returning to the dashboard quits the application.  It could be
         useful to have it continuing to operate in the background,
         displaying a status icon in the iPhone status bar.

  - Then What Actually Works?!?

       - Map drawing (with minor flaws), zooming (no iPhone-style pinching
         yet), panning.
       - GPS connection to gpsd
       - roadmap.screenobjects can be edited to show various buttons with
         various actions.
       - Trip logging
       - Drivers
       - Speech synthesis using flite -- requires flite from Saurik: 
          http://www.telesphoreo.org/browser/trunk/data/flite

  - Future Enhancements

       To fix all known issues, naturally :-)



== Familiar Support ==

     This section describes the installation of RoadMap on an
     ARM-powered PDA running Familiar Linux and the GPE graphic
     environment.  The full README should be used as well, of course.

     **Some of the instructions below are dated.  Proceed with caution.**

  - BEFORE THE INSTALL

    - Removing a prior installation of RoadMap

       Since RoadMap 1.0.4 the path to the maps has changed.  In addition
       there is no more package for the maps (the maps are too big for that
       and there was only one example map anyway).  Therefore the
       roadmap-sfca package should be removed first
```
       ipkg remove roadmap-sfca
```

       The name of the RoadMap package has also changed from roadmap-gtk2 to
       roadmap. Therefore the roadmap-gtk2 package should be removed:
```
       ipkg remove roadmap-gtk2
```

    - Making room for RoadMap

       On a PDA with 32Mb of RAM, GPE takes most of the available space and
       less than 2Mb of RAM is left available.  For RoadMap to work one
       need to make some room.  The author recommends removing xstroke and
       the GPE help from the bottom panel.

       Another problem is a bug in the Familiar X server that causes the
       file ~/.xsession-errors to grow infinitely in the ramdisk, eating up
       all the available RAM in a matter of days.
       
       The work-around is to not start the ipaq-sleep daemon.  To do this,
       comment out the line "/etc/init.d/ipaq-sleep start" in the file:
```
           /etc/X11/Xsession.d/69ipaq-sleep
```
    - Installing gpsd

       RoadMap depends on gpsd for receiving data from the GPS device. Therefore
       the gpsd package must be installed:
```
       ipkg install gpsd
```
       Once this has been done, the serial line must be configured for using gpsd
       (see the serial line configuration tool in the Settings folder).

    - Installing flite

       RoadMap uses flite for generating the voice announcements. RoadMap
       can be used without flite, but it will stay silent then.

       Note that flite is a very big program: it should be installed on the
       MMC, SD or CompactFlash (CF) card. Installing flite is easy: just copy
       the executable file. The problem is more where to find the executable..

  - INSTALLING ROADMAP

       There are three steps: first install the RoadMap package, then install
       some maps and last setup your preferences if you installed RoadMap in
       a custom way.

    - Installing from the Familiar package

       If available at all, the RoadMap familiar distribution contains one .ipk
       package file.  This package contains the RoadMap executables (roadmap and
       roadgps) as well as the configuration files for a GTK 2.0 setup (such as
       the Familiar 0.7.2 GPE image).  This package does not contain the map files
       or the map index file.

       If RoadMap is available from your feed:
```
       ipkg install roadmap
```
       If you downloaded the ipk files on the iPAQ:
```
       ipkg install roadmap_X.Y.Z_arm.ipk
```
       RoadMap is useless without maps. The maps can be downloaded from the
       web site (http://roadmap.sourceforge.net/maps.html or mirrors) or
       generated from the US Census Bureau's files (see later).

       It is strongly recommended you install the maps on a CompactFlash or
       SD/MMC card, and not on the iPAQ internal flash. The reason is that the
       maps are way too big to be installed on the iPAQ flash. As configured,
       RoadMap will look for the maps either in

               - /mnt/hda/share/roadmap or
               - /mnt/card/share/roadmap.
               -

       (This can be changed using the Map.Path item in the RoadMap preferences
       dialog.)

       The set of maps for California represents more that 100 Mbyte of data,
       the whole US about 1.6 Gbyte. Unless you are the lucky owner of a large
       capacity CompactFlash, you will have to install a subset. A capacity of
       128 Mbyte is enough in most cases, 64 Mbyte might be enough if you do not
       travel far from home.

       To build the maps yourself, you need the Linux/i686 binary or the source
       tarball. See the next section for more details.

    - Installing maps

       The RoadMap package is preconfigured for maps stored either in a MMC,
       SD or CompactFlash (CF) card.  The map files must be installed in a
       subdirectory of the device's root directory named "share/roadmap". 
       The reason for that is to follow standard UNIX convention and make it
       easier to store other types of data in the device (such as MP3 files).

       The file system used for the device is indifferent (RoadMap maps comply
       with the 8+3 limitation of the FAT file system) but VFAT is recommended
       (if only because this is the factory default file system).

       The default Map.Path on the Zaurus is:

             + ROADMAP_MAP_DIR, chosen at compile time,
             + /opt/QtPalmtop/share/roadmap/..., and its subdirectories,
             + /mnt/cf/QtPalmtop/share/roadmap/... (preferred path) and
               its subdirectories, and
             + /mnt/card/QtPalmtop/share/roadmap/... and its subdirectories.
             +

       The last two directories are located on a memory card, as this would
       be the only reasonable place where to install the maps considering
       their size.

       The map files can be retrieved from the RoadMap site:

           http://roadmap.sourceforge.net

       The first file to install in the share/roadmap subdirectory is the file
       named "usdir.rdm". This file is mandatory: this is the index used to
       retrieve all other map files. All other files are optional: one can load
       a limited subset of maps only. If a map is not available, RoadMap will
       issue a warning message.

    - Setting the user preferences

       Start Roadmap, select **File / Preferences**. The preferences dialog is
       made of a (long) serie of tabbed screens. Most preferences do not need
       to be modified.

    - Configuration Files

      Although the Sharp Zaurus runs linux, its setup is somewhat unusual,
      and the location of the configuration files is different than the
      standard install.

      The rationale for the selected setup, which is typical of a PDA, is to
      try to make RoadMap an auto-installed option when sliding in the proper
      memory card. So the locations for files always include the Zaurus mount
      points for the CompactFlash or SD cards.

      The configuration directories on the Sharp Zaurus PDA are:

             + /opt/QtPalmtop/share/roadmap,
             + /mnt/cf/QtPalmtop/share/roadmap (preferred path),
             + /mnt/card/QtPalmtop/share/roadmap and
             + ~/.roadmap.
             +
