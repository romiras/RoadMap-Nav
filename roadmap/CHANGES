Roadmap v1.1.1 (??)

 Items marked (*) originated on Ehud Shabtai's roadmap_editor code branch.

[ list current as of 1/2/2008, courtesy 'cvs2cl.pl -l "-rv1_1_0::HEAD"' ]
  
  * Initial localization support, ported from editor branch by
  Alessandro Briosi. (*)

  * Reorder latitude/longitude fields in Find-->Position dialog, to
  better match common practice.  Added in-dialog syntax help as well.

  * Properly render fully-shaped TIGER polygons.  Polygons with holes,
  and overlapping polygons, may still not render correctly.

  * Screenshots (where supported) are now named with date/time.

  * Various QT/QT4/QPE4 fixes from Junqian Gordon Xu and
  Alessandro Briosi.

  * Added support for building .rdm files from OpenStreetMap
  data.  See (temporary) README.osm for usage details.

  * Validate value of AGG selection during build.  Fix misleading text
  in README regarding AGG selection.

  * Rearrange options processing slightly so standard toolkit options
  can be discovered (e.g. "-sync").

  * Fix bug which flipped sign of some lat/lon values between 0
  and -1 degrees.

  * Improved aesthetic in roadgps, from Alessandr Briosi.

  * Added ability to add text (with optional outline box) to a sprite,
  either directly, or via a screen object that can provide dynamic
  text values.

  * Added minimal "mapinfo" action, which reports dimensions and location
  of current map view.  (Help-->Map Parameters)

  * Support for overlay rendering of externally-provided polygon objects.
  (Pascal Martin).

  * Support for VII location protocol.  (Pascal Martin)
  
  
Roadmap v1.1.0 (October, 2007)

 Items marked (*) originated on Ehud Shabtai's roadmap_editor code branch.

  * GPX data interchange support has been added.  A single GPX file,
  containing waypoints, routes, and tracks, represents a RoadMap
  "Trip".

  * Landmarks (waypoints) can be created/deleted/edited/moved either
  via mouse or dialog.  Deleted landmarks are saved, and can be
  undeleted (even into a different trip).

  * GPS track display (breadcrumb trail) based on distance, time, or
  path deviation, with robust saves to disk, even if roadmap
  crashes.

  * Street and landmark labels are now rendered on-screen, using
  either the system or a primitive internal font (which has
  tuneable size).  Labels will be angled to align with the
  street, if the font permits.  (*)

  * "Feature" files -- GPX-based lists of "points of interest", with
  tuneable coloring, display sprites, labeling, and decluttering

  * Per-side-of-street address ranges now work correctly.  (*)

  * Roads with no addresses are now searchable.  Addresses now
  stored as unsigned.

  * Address searching now knows about "common" streat/road abbreviations.

  * Can now display screen dimensions (in miles or km) in a "sign"
  display message.

  * "Long lines", those which begin and end in non-adjacent squares,
  are now saved in a separate list.  This guarantees they will always
  be displayed.  The extra expense is similar to that for polygons,
  which are also not displayed "by square". (*)

  * Support for Canadian RNF maps added.
  
  * Support for US State boundary maps added.

  * Paths in preferences (e.g. Map.Path) can now specify directories
  ending in "/...", to indicate that tall subdirectories should be
  searched as well.

  * AGG support.  GTK2 can now display using anti-aliased lines. (*)

  * Long and right clicks can now bring up a configurable popup menu.

  * Extended the implementation of popup menus -- they can now be bound
  to other menu items, which allows for cascading menu
  effects.  Popups can also be bound to toolbar buttons.

  * On-screen state indicators and control points (i.e. active icons)
  based on RoadMap sprites, for display and control of some RoadMap
  features.  On-screen sprites can now invoke any action or popup,
  just as menus and toolbar buttons can. (*)

  * 3D "perspective" viewing mode mode. (*)

  * Railroads will now be displayed.

  * Performance improvements (both space and time) for very sparse maps.

  * GTK/GTK2 dialogs are now modeless.

  * Allow for more polygons (from 65K to 1M).

  * Additional QT support for tooltips, button icons, initial
  width/height settings.  New QT4 support.

  * Makefiles rewritten for better modularity and readability.  Rules
  for tarball creation incorporated into makefiles.

  * rdmgenmaps is now easier to use -- can now specify a state name.  Also,
  all of the rdmgenxxxxx scripts now take a more uniform set of options, and
  they all have proper usage messages.

  * buildus got a new "-c" option, which tells it to look for maps
  along the configured Map.Path preferences item. 

  * Can now replay NMEA data from a file (produced, for example, by gpsbabel)

  * Signals are now caught gracefully, so that unsaved
  landmark/trip/track files can be preserved.

  * Performance improvements -- if processing a county above a
  given zoom level produces no drawing, this will be remembered,
  and that county won't be processed again at that zoom level or
  above.

  * Support for latest census maps (2006se)

  * ImageMagick (for "convert") now optional when building.

  * 64-bit compatibility.  Probably needs further testing.

  * Map schema changed to eliminate hard-coded layers.

  * Many buildmap improvements, in terms of modularity.

  * Initial work on architecture independent map exchange format and tool.

  * Initial work to allow cross-compiling RoadMap for WinCE using
  arm-wince-mingw32ce toolchain.

Roadmap v1.0.12 (November 4, 2005)

  * Makefile cleanup: everything must now be built in src. If only
      one toolkit support is to be built, use the DESKTOP option. Please
      read the README file for more information.

  * Small addition to the README file, section "troubleshooting".

  * RoadMap uses a minimum refresh period to avoid recomputing the screen
      too often. This period is now a preference. Not that you normally would
      want to change this, but this helps on some very specific setups.

  * The --debug option now accepts a list of source files as parameters.

  * Reworked the roadmap_trip.c API, to have a common API between the
      current trip module and the upcoming one from Paul.

  * Make RoadMap resynchronize with the graphic engine (X11) before drawing
      a new map. Don't redraw if the graphic engine is busy. This is intended
      as an attempt to avoid overloading the X server on a PDA (Paul Fox).

  * Support defining a sprite as an alias of another sprite (Paul Fox).

  * Show the preference categories sorted in alphabetical order, to
      makes it easier to retrieve a category tab.

  * Expand all paths, including the hard-coded ones (Ehud Shabtai).

  * Fix the handling of the end-of-file when the GPS source is a NMEA log
      file.

  * User preference to decide what side to draw the toolbar on: top
      (default), right, bottom or left. (Not yet available on Windows CE.)

  * A fix for the shape gap filler code in buildmap. buildmap generated
      wrong shapes for long lines (Ehud Shabtai).

  * The menus are now user configurable, in a way similar to the toolbar.
      The actions can be renamed, to match the size of the screen better
      (Paul Fox and I).

  * The minimal mouse/pen movement required to initiate a map drag is
      now configurable: some screen digitizers have a significant jitter,
      but a large value is incomfortable on a desktop machine (Paul Fox).

Roadmap v1.0.11 (September 9, 2005)

  * Merged a patch from Gergely Molnar to make screenshots of the
      RoadMap canvas. Only the first patch was merged (single screenshot).
      Still trying to figure out how the 2nd patch works (record a "movie"
      of the trip).

  * Removed arbitrary string size limits in the driver's protocol by using
      dynamically allocated strings (garbage collected using reference count).

  * Fixed a gcc 4.0 complain.

  * Fixed some type errors in the math functions (max() is for int!).

  * Fixed a bug in the NMEA decoding (thanks to Ehud Shabtai). This bug
      might explain several other issues people had.

  * Many changes to make RoadMap more portable to other OSes.

  * Added some missing files to the distribution: a default "session" and
      the man pages.

  * The toolbars can now be configured by the user, to fit small screens
      with the user's preferred controls.

  * RoadMap now supports the gpsd native protocol. The user can select
      to use either the NMEA raw mode (gpsd://...) or the new native mode
      (gpsd2://...).

  * RoadMap is now available on Microsoft Windows CE.
      (port implemented and maintained by Ehud Shabtai).

  * Drivers can now "link" to RoadMap using a TCP connection (required
      for WinCE, which does not provide pipes).

  * RoadMap can now redistribute the NMEA data to the drivers (it simulates
      the NMEA data if the feed protocol is not NMEA).

  * Fixed the sunset/sunrise calculation (tested against LA, London, Paris).

  * Added the object pseudo-protocol: Roadmap to use one driver's object
      as GPS source. This makes it possible for a driver to supply the GPS
      position. Configuration syntax: object:.

  * Merged a patch by Ehud Shabtai, plus some improvements: when zooming
      in, the streets now have a border and look more professional.

  * Merged a patch by Ehud Shabtai: the map view follows a mouse drag.

  * Updated RoadMap to support the US Census Bureau 2004 Second Edition.

  * Avoid repeating an error message when a map file is not found.

  * Changed the RoadGps log file mechanism to let the user select what
      and where the log file will be (using a file selection dialog).

Roadmap v1.0.10 (may 15, 2005)

  * Added a decoder for the NMEA sentence GPGGA  (provides the altitude).

  * Added the altitude to the information that can be shown on the
      display (using the tag %H).

  * Fixed the Find / Position dialog, which now decode the ISO 6709-1983
      format correctly, with extensions: the traditional W, E, N, and S
      are accepted, either as prefix or suffix.

  * Fixed some packaging errors (the make files need to be in the binary
      distribution so that "make install" can be used) and improve the
      documentation in this regard.

  * Fixed the roadgps screen (GTK2 bug) and merged some of the ideas
      from RoadMap/Kismet (satellite rectangle is proportional to signal
      strength, but I keep the bargraph for now--more readable).

  * Don't require the user to acknowledge each map download (very
      inconvenient when driving). Another (good) idea from Kismet users.

  * Accept NMEA sentences from any standard source. Correct interpretation
      of proprietary NMEA sentences.

  * Fixed the QT map background problem (was always white). Does QPE
      needs hardcoded colors?

  * Kismet users don't want the navigation enabled. Deal with all users
      preferences by recording the navigation flag in the RoadMap session
      (so that the user's choice becomes persistent).

  * Kismet users don't want to hear any voice. Deal with all users
      preferences by recording the voice mute flag in the RoadMap session
      (so that the user's choice becomes persistent).

  * Kismet users don't want the display to rotate. Make the rotation a
      user preference instead of a menu choice. This simplifies the user
      interface, the code and will (hopefully) make everyone happy.

  * Implement a driver architecture to allow interfacing to other
      systems without modifying RoadMap. This also make it possible to
      show other (fix or mobile) objects than the vehicule.

  * Implemented a (useless but fun) "ghost" driver to serve as a test
      for the driver mechanism and as a small example of a RoadMap driver.

  * Integrated the Kismet interface as a RoadMap driver. Still untested.

  * Removed the spurious message that trip "default" does not exists when
      starting RoadMap for the first time.

  * Modified the make files to solve problems on MAC OS X.

  * Expanded on the description of the installation directories and
      added a related entry in the help menu.

  * Merge a patch by Horst Raap to show small distances in meter or feet.

  * Added a driver for gpsdrive's friends protocol.

Roadmap v1.0.9 (March 7, 2005)

  * Fix a compilation problem with gcc 3.4 and possibly gcc 3.3.

  * Almost completly clean the "north, south, west, east" thing.

  * Fix some GCC "pedantic" warnings.

  * Get rid of the C++ comment style in plain C code (no "//").

  * Change the search path for configuration files: this search
      path is now hardcoded (chicken and egg problem if the path
      to the configuration file is itself configured..) and is
      independent from the map search path. It also include /etc/roadmap
      to let sysadmin configure a local machine setup.

  * Change the default map search path to become more compliant with the
      Linux FHS: use /var/lib/roadmap and /usr/lib/roadmap (all "share"
      files should be architecture-independent, but the rdm files are C
      structures..). The directories /usr/share/roadmap and
      /usr/local/share/roadmap are still in the default path to maintain
      compatibility, but these will be removed in a future release.
      Please notice the default preferences file has not been modified yet.

  * Don't blindly assume GPGSA always includes the max number of satellites.

  * Remove an obsolete --path option (regression in 1.0.8).

  * Support the 2004 edition of the Tiger files.

  * Extensive cleanup of the make files for building a Debian package
      (or more exactly to facilitate the building of a Debian package).

Roadmap v1.0.8 (November 8, 2004)

  * Fix a GPS source selection problem: when launched from RoadMap,
      roadgps now uses the same GPS source option as set for RoadMap.

  * Generate an error is a required configuration file is missing,
      such as schema (thanks to James L. McNeill for finding this one).

  * Improve the make files: it is now possible to choose one toolkit
      at the top level (option DESKTOP=toolkit) and the gtk2 makefile
      behaves better when used with a cross compiler.

  * Temporarily allow the use of obsolete GTK features to stay
      compatible with GTK 2.4.

  * Use the "action" design pattern for describing the menu and toolbar,
      as this is the normal way for GTK 2.4 and QT 3. The GTK and QT code
      has not been migrated yet: the roadmap_factory translates the new
      data structure into the old GUI interface for now.

  * Redesigned the interface between buildmap_main.c and buildmap_tiger.c
      to make it more generic and to be able to support shapefiles (see below).
      This redesign causes the interface of buildmap to be different from
      previous versions (rdmgenmaps was upgraded and still has the same
      interface as before).

  * Added a prototype of shapefile support. This is not yet fully usable
      as is, except if you are ready for some coding on your own :-). The
      problem is that shapefiles are really a family of formats rather than
      a well defined standard. (provided by Stephen Woodbridge.)

  * Added support for the Digital Charts of the World, i.e. major routes
      for most of the world. Still incomplete, but functional. This can be
      viewed as a simple example on how to convert shapefiles. (provided
      by Stephen Woodbridge.)

  * Fix the usdir.rdm format--a short was used for fips (reported by
      Stephen Woodbridge). Note this fix means that usdir.rdm MUST be
      upgraded. RoadMap was modified to check this. Note also that only US
      territories in the Pacific and caraibes were impacted by this bug.

  * Fix for a potential division by zero when a block contains only
      one address (thanks to Stephen Woodbridge for finding this one).

  * Fix a RoadGps crash when receiving the position of 16 satellites:
      RoadGps was limited to 12 satellite max, and did not check the NMEA
      data was over this limit..

  * Increase the limit on the number of "squares" RoadMap can visualize
      on one screen. This is an internal limit that prevents from zooming
      out when using maps generated from the Digital Charts of the World.

  * Some minor cleanups in the RoadMap code: replace as many insane
      "north, south, west, east" sequences of argument with a new type
      used all over the place. This is unfinished business, still.

Roadmap v1.0.7 (July 5, 2004)

  * Fix some gcc warning against libpopt primitives.

  * Fix some potential overflow problems (no actual problem was reported).

  * Switch to gcc 3.3 and QT3. RoadMap compiles clean with QT3 as long
      as the QT2 compatibility header are installed (qdialog.h, qlist.h
      qvector.h, etc..).

  * Follow suggestion by Akkana Peck: tolerate spaces between the '?' and
      the city name when using fuzzy searches.

  * Follow suggestion by Paul Fox: tar files to use a directory name made
      with the version number (i.e. roadmap-1.0.7).

  * Fix a street selection problem: activate the proper county when
      the user selects a street from a list (Find Address..). Bug reported
      by Mark Whitis.

  * GTK2 only: set the first item as selected when opening a list.

Roadmap v1.0.6 (May 30, 2004):

  * Fix by Paul Fox: RoadMap may crash at the intersection of counties
      if the street search causes another map to become current.

  * Minimally decent help, using the HTML manual and a web browser.

  * Minor documentation changes: describe the use of aptconvert, make it
      explicit that RoadMap can be used without a GPS receiver.

  * The documentation tar file now contains a complete copy of the RoadMap
      web site's html pages.
  * Take into account the disappearance of roadmap.saignon.net.

  * Please note: some sqlite code has been included, but no functional
      point of interest is available yet.

Roadmap v1.0.5 (December 25, 2003):

  * The Familiar package is now built with "-march=armv4 -mtune=xscale"
      (thanks to Philip Blundell for the info).

  * Integrated the sunrise/sunset calculation from Eric Domazlicky. At
      that time this information is only used for display. In the future
      it may be used to decide between night and day themes.

  * A regression was fixed in buildmap: merging address range ended
      with the wrong city name. The maps on the RoadMap sites are not
      impacted.

  * Merging the ranges created another problem: at some point RoadMap
      checks if the given address matches the street side, a invalid check
      when it comes to a merged range. The check was improved to limit the
      odds of not finding an address, but a potential problem still remains.
      Note that the maps available on the RoadMap web site have no merged
      range, and are thus not impacted.

  * Some cleanup in the RoadMap icon management: the search order is
      not only more logical, it has also become documented.

  * Some cleanup in the declutter section: the obscure rules for
      decluttering polygons and shapes have been replaced with rules
      based on the visible size of each object. This is step one toward
      a more sensible declutter management, as suggested by Russ Nelson.

  * Rethink the drawing (stacking) order of information on the map, so
      that waypoints sprites don't show up on top of the street signs.
      The order is now, from bottom to top: waypoints, trip info, street
      signs.

Roadmap v1.0.4 (November 22, 2003):

  * Changed the name of the familiar package to "roadmap" to
      conform with Familiar's guidelines.

  * Repaired the voice problem with GPE (waitpid() does not work
      when RoadMap started from the application manager--might be
      caused by a process group not set?).

  * Use some official road signs (and a few hand-made icons) for the
      toolbar, because the Gnome toolbar setting "Icon Only" has a weird
      effect when there is no icon (thanks to Mathias Kolehmainen for
      helping to solve this problem--my archives show the first sighting
      was actually reported by Darrick Hartman long time ago).

  * Made the icon above optional with the preference item General.Icons,
      so that one can avoid using them on small screens (such as the iPAQ).
      For small screens, either the icons or the label will be shown, not
      both.

  * Do not use SIGCHLD by default, since there are the above problems
      with GPE.

  * Added a "documentation" package, for those downloading the Familiar
      package through IpkgFind or a Familiar feed.

  * Made the documentation available as HTML on the RoadMap web sites
      (RoadMap README--renamed "Manual"--and the Familiar INSTALL notes).

Roadmap v1.0.3 (November 2, 2003):

  * Fix loading the sprite file twice if one directory earlier in
      the path does not have a sprite file (contributed by Mathias
      Kolehmainen).

  * Add preliminary support for GPE (tested with familiar v0.7.1).

  * Create a desktop environment: .desktop file and pixmaps. The
      icons were produced using the (excellent) SignMaker applet.

      {{ http://www.kurumi.com/roads/signmaker/sm220.html }}

      The desktop environment was made according to the GPE
      guidelines (icons size 48x48).

  * Cleanup the make files: use GNU make's conditional for handling
      the GPE or QPE options and the DEBUG mode.

  * Make it possible to cross-compile RoadMap, for example by using:
-------------------------------------
      make CC=arm-linux-gcc AR=arm-linux-ar
-------------------------------------

  * Support 2 new general purpose signs, placed at the center of the map:
      "Info" and "Error".

  * When the visible area do not match any available map, generate an
      information sign on the screen, so that the user knows what's going on.

  * Reorganized the familiar packages: no more Gtk 1.2 and map packages.
      The map files are now looked for on the MMC/SD or CompactFlash device
      using the Familar standard mount point in the hope this makes RoadMap
      better integrated in Familiar/GPE.

Roadmap v1.0.2 (October 5, 2003 -- the Scot Wilcoxon version :-): 

  * Fix RoadMap crashes when ~/.roadmap does not exist (contributed by
      Scot Wilcoxon).

  * Integrate a GPS position offset, as a work-around for map problems
      (rework of a patch contributed by Scot Wilcoxon). Compare to the
      original patch from Scot, this change uses different types for the
      GPS and map positions, so that there is no confusion when to adjust.
      The adjustment logic has also been isolated in its own module (likely
      to be modified soon, as the current constant offset method is way too
      simplistic). The adjustment is also performed as late as possible, so
      that the original GPS position is the one saved in the session file.

  * The GPS steering is not reliable when the speed is too low (too close
      to GPS error margins). This was taken care of wherever the steering was
      used: the roadmap_gps module is now taking care of this at once so that
      the rest of RoadMap can rely on stable data.

Roadmap v1.0.1 (September 14, 2003): 

  * Added a "Hold Map" menu item (and toolbar button), to hold the map
      still when one tries to select a street or just check the map. Looking
      at details when the map is moving is quite uncomfortable..

  * Added a "GPS position" entry in the Find menu.

  * Separated the geocoding code from the address dialog code, so that
      the geocoding function can be reused in other places without depending
      on a GUI interface.

  * The map builder code was modified so that the left and right ranges
      are merged when matching (i.e. same range, one odd numbers and the
      other one even numbers). This reduces the overall size of the map
      files by 4-5% (75 MBytes saved for a total size of about 1.6 Gbytes).
      The map files available on the RoadMap web sites have not been
      regenerated (this is not worth the effort).

      This change does not cause any map compatibility issue with previous
      releases of RoadMap.

  * Added much more keyboard bindings, so that almost all the alphabet
      characters are in use now.. This was done to please my loyal Zaurus
      fans :-) Also added a "dump" of the current bindings when using the
      --help option, so that people can check what is supported.

Roadmap v1.0 (September 1, 2003): 

  * The "trip direction" red arrow sprite was acting weird when moving
      the map's view (pan and rotate). The cause was that the sprite's
      coordinates were not rotated as these should have been.

  * Fix a RoadMap crash when GPS data is received while downloading: this
      was because RoadMap was mapping the file being downloaded, before
      it was complete. The (temporary) solution is to freeze any RoadMap
      GPS and screen update. The long term solution should be to transfer
      the map to a temporary file and then rename it.

  * Implement download using the HTTP protocol.

  * Uncompress gzip, bzip2 and lzop files after download, detected using
      well known suffixes. Downloading compressed files helps cut the
      download time by a factor of 2 in average (using gzip).

Roadmap v1.0rc9 (August 24, 2003): 

  * Added an on-the-fly map download mode. When this mode is enabled,
      and if a map file is not found, RoadMap asks the user to confirm
      downloading the map. It is also possible to remove maps, of course.

  * Changed the list management in the Qt code, so that a single click
      is all what's needed to select an object, rather than a double click
      that is always annoying on a PDA (and on X11 as well..).

  * Fixed some alignment problems in the Qt module.

  * Fixed the ever extending list box in Qt: clean the list before
      updating (i.e. repopulating) it.

  * Refresh the screen periodically, not each time the GPS information is
      received. This helps RoadMap catching up when it is too slow to process
      the GPS information on time, and avoid RoadMap to become unresponsive
      to user actions. A side visual effect is to make RoadMap seems to
      "jump" from a position to the next, becoming not as smooth as before.

  * Do not stop a trip just because the map's focus has changed.

Roadmap v1.0rc8 (August 2, 2003): 

  * Redesigned the navigation module. Navigation is now based on fuzzy
      logic and takes into account the position, direction and speed of
      the car, as well as the street connectivity (to "promote" streets
      connected to the current street).

  * Do not stop at the first street when searching for any city (i.e.
      when prefixing the city name with '?').

  * Add history to the intersection and coordinates dialogs.

  * Improve debug trace to be able to filter per source file (i.e. enable
      trace for a specific source file only), option syntax: --debug=source.

Roadmap v1.0rc7 (July 4, 2003): 

  * Do not use SIGCHLD anymore, as it seems to crash in some cases on
      FreeBSD (signal portability problem ?).

  * Fixed the generation of maps when the street numbers do not fit into
      a 16 bit integer (the Hawaii maps must be regenerated).

  * Have all the necessary characters in the Gtk keyboard: '?' and '-'.

  * Use a lot less memory for the squares grid (but no less than needed..).

  * Change the RoadMap user interface to be more compliant with the Gnome's
      Human Interface Guide. Mostly, this is following common sense advices.

  * Fix yet another "square -2" error.

  * Merged QT changes by Latchesar Ionkov.

  * Merged an additional feature by Latchesar Ionkov: find a place using
      coordinates (Longitude, Latitude).

  * Merged and extended the session context changes by Latchesar Ionkov:
      RoadMap now saves the latest display context on exit and restores this
      context on restart. Basically, the initial RoadMap display now shows
      the same area as when the user last exited, using the same zoom level
      and rotation.

  * Keep the display offsets (up, down, left, right and rotation) in GPS
      tracking mode. This way it is possible to position the GPS symbol at
      the bottom of the screen or setup the map in a (very rough) "landscape"
      mode (beware: the signs are not rotated..).

  * Do not show the navigation signs (current street, next intersection)
      when not tracking the GPS position. Note that the voice messages are
      not filtered the same way (bug or feature ?).

  * Selecting a street on the map does not overwrite anymore the location
      selected using a dialog (address, intersection or position). This makes
      the "L" button much more usable.

  * Fixed a few potential memory leaks. There are probably other leaks
      because the size of the RoadMap process memory grows when replaying
      the same trip log over and over.

  * Fixed the error recovery when the user selects a trip file that does
      not exist, or when the latest trip has been deleted.

Roadmap v1.0rc6 (June 2, 2003): 

  * This is a brown bag version: fix 3 regressions and one old bug found
      after a single trip (with a brand new GPS receiver :-).

  * Voice was silenced.

  * Don't consider the direction if the speed is at the noise level. In
      this case the direction is pure junk because the only movement is
      GPS errors.

  * When a sign is shown on more than one line, the text was truncated
      to its first line after 1 second. In fact, the text was truncated
      after first displayed: any refresh thereafter shows the damage.

  * The old bug: the number of parameters in the NMEA GPGSV sentence
      actually depends on the number of satellites listed, it is not
      always greater than 9.

Roadmap v1.0rc5 (June 1, 2003): 

  * Integrated the "find by intersection" feature by Latchesar Ionkov:
      try "Screen / Show Location..". This is a really neat feature, thanks
      Latchesar!

  * RoadMap and RoadGps now periodically attempt to reconnect to gpsd
      if the connection has failed.

  * RoadMap now has a "full screen" mode when using GTK2 (not GTK or QT).
      Too bad my window manager does not seem to cooperate: nothing happens.
      Or maybe is it a bug in RoadMap? I don't know yet..

  * Two garmin-specific MNEA sentences have been implemented: one to detect
      when the GPS receiver's datum is not compatible with RoadMap (must be
      NAD83 or WGS 84), the second to get the estimated position error (EPE).
      Note RoadMap should work with no problem with other brands: the EPE
      will stay at its original worst case value and the datum check will
      never be performed.

  * Fixed several errors in the code that search the closest street (used
      for street selection and street navigation). This should lead to
      a more stable street identification & navigation.

  * The navigation module now searches for the next intersection only
      if the car's speed is greater than the GPS precision worst case.
      This improves RoadMap's stability when the car has stopped.

  * RoadMap is in the middle of a redesign of the navigation module,
      using fuzzy logic and considering the car location, direction vs.
      the street geometry. This version includes all the changes required
      for providing the navigation module with the necessary information.
      The next step is to rewrite the navigation module itself.

Roadmap v1.0rc4 (May 11, 2003): 

  * Fixed a fatal error in the navigation code when driving not too
      far from a county border.

  * Fixed a fatal error in the map activation code: the current map
      was not updated correctly if it was already in the cache.

  * The RoadMap debug log messages are now saved to a file. A rough
      stack information is displayed (quick and dirty). This is the
      result of the bug hunt above.

  * The user can now disable and re-enable the navigation features
      (this way it is possible to skip them when they crash RoadMap 8-).

  * The "trip stop" menu item now preserves the screen orientation
      selected by the user when activating the trip.

  * Fixed a signal programming bug that hit the Zaurus port
      (thanks to Latchesar Ionkov).

  * Makefile cleanups.

Roadmap v1.0rc3 (April 20, 2003): 

  * Hopefully made street tracking more stable.

  * Added detection of the next intersection.. with spotty results.

  * The navigation module is now called from the GPS event callback
      and not anymore from the screen module. This avoids going through
      screen-oriented filters.

  * Some type cleanups (i.e. use 'const' as much as possible).

Roadmap v1.0rc2 (April 13, 2003): 

  * Fixed street tracking when more than one county is visible.

  * Cleanup and reorganization: prepare the detection of the next
      intersection.

  * A few code optimizations.

  * Fix a RoadGps bug that shows up with GTK2.

  * Fix text mixup when both the "selected street" and "current
      street" signs are displayed.

  * More stable street tracking.

Roadmap v1.0rc1 (April 6, 2003): 

  * Added Gtk 2.0 support as an alternative GUI.

  * Integrated Qt support as an alternative GUI, thanks to Latchesar
      Ionkov. The Qt implementation includes an optional QPE support for
      the Sharp Zaurus PDA.

  * Detect the current street and show its name on the screen.

  * Double all street information on the screen with audio messages.
      This feature is user configurable, the RoadMap default coniguration
      uses the flite program.

  * Some code cleanup and reorganization.

  * Updated the README file.

Roadmap v0.15 (March 16, 2003): 

  * Improve trip load and save: use the GTK file selection dialog.

  * Trip on-screen information now include current time and speed.

  * Trip on-screen information has been made user configurable.

  * The geometry of the RoadMap windows can now be configured, either through the
        preferences dialog or from the command line.

  * Cleanup the roadmap command line options, added --help.

  * Some code cleanup and reorganization.

  * Updated the README file.

Roadmap v0.14 (March 4, 2003): 

  * New trip support: save trip, load trip, add & delete waypoints, start
      trip (shows additional information), etc.. This comes with a new menu
      organization.

  * Support for coming back from a trip: targets the departure point.

  * Fix toolbar enable/disable logic, which was broken in a previous change.

  * Cleanups: make more use of the C's "const" keyword.

  * Once again, better isolation of UNIX specific dependencies.

  * Improve makefiles, so that a source change is recompiled as expected.

Roadmap v0.13 (February 17, 2003): 

  * Added scrollbars to the street selection list window, to handle long 
  lists. 

  * Add fuzzy city search and make the street number optional, both options 
  are meant to allow broad searches. 

  * Add two options to define verbosity levels. Make the log INFO and DEBUG 
  levels optional, so that they can be used. This adds the --verbose and --debug 
  command line options to gtkroadmap. 

  * Add a configurable address history to the address dialog. This history can 
  be purged from the RoadMap File menu. 

  * Fixed the missing rdmcompare. When will I stop forgetting new scripts each 
  new release ? 

  * Cleaned up the Makefile and made libpopt dependency explicit (thanks to 
  George MacDonald).

Roadmap v0.12 (February 14, 2003): 

  * Fixed a floating point exception in buildmap due to a bad calculation of 
  the grid required to cover a county (maps available for download are OK: this 
  bug was found when building them). 

  * Added rdmcompare, a small tool to check that all counties have been 
  translated into RoadMap map files. 

  * Fixed two bugs in the address retrieval logic, which caused spurious 
  multiple matches (it matched the same block more than once..) 

  * In case of multiple matches, show the list of streets that match and help 
  the user select one. 

  * As the county subdivisions and place areas collide, there are unintended 
  consequences merging the two. For now, only use the place information if 
  exists (if not, the county subdivision is used anyway). Longer term solution 
  is to separate the two and search through one and the other separately (and 
  join the result). 

  * Isolate the Unix dependencies better: the default directory path to be 
  defined in one place only. This is still a work in progress. 

  * Handle the street prefix, suffix and type fields. These may be entered in 
  the street name field. They are recognized automatically.

Roadmap v0.11 (February 1st, 2003): 

  * Switched the default to the US Census Bureau's 2002 Tiger file format. 

  * Fixed a fatal error with 2002 city descriptions. 

  * Buildmap and buildus can now generate map files to an arbitrary directory 
  (instead of the current directory). 

  * Renamed the scripts "makemap" and "downloadmap" in an attempt to avoid 
  name conflicts with other software projects. 

  * Take the list of counties from the US Census Bureau's file app_a02.txt 
  instead of AllSt.txt, because the later does not seem to be maintained (it 
  does not match the 2002 list of counties anymore). 

  * Fixed problems with street numbers in Wisconsin (and some other states). 
  All in all, the street number problem is still a sore point: these are not 
  numerical, therefore street ranges are not really ranges anymore. The current 
  code is a hack that attempt to extract a reasonable numerical number from the 
  actual street "number". 

  * Fixed a bug with small counties that fit in a single "square": the map 
  file was generated corrupted and RoadMap could not use it.

Roadmap v0.10 (December 22nd, 2002): 

  * Fixed the Wyoming visibility problem. 

  * Fixed the missing unix subdirectory and map build scripts (oops..). 

  * Fixed the default zoom level logic. 

  * Optimization: draw points instead of lines when the object was reduced to 
  a single display point (for example when zoomed out enough to show several 
  states). 

  * Optimization: do not show polygons reduced to a single display point. 

 Please note that the content of the map files has slightly changed due to 
 these changes. The map files must be downloaded again, or regenerated, when 
 upgrading RoadMap to version 0.11. 

Roadmap v0.9 (December 15th, 2002): 

  * Fixed the trail declutter level setting. 

  * Fixed the state visibility problem. 

  * Fixed the island visibility problem (also known as the disapearing 
  Catalina Island problem). 

  * The makefile now has a separate installation for the software (plus 
  configuration files) and for the maps. This is because the maps are usually 
  built later on, probably out of the RoadMap directories. 

  * Started to isolate UNIX API dependencies. 

  * The buildmap tool can now create maps one state at a time (option 
  --state=XX). 

  * Created the makemap and downloadmap scripts to simplify the process of 
  downloading and building maps.

Roadmap v0.8 (December 1st, 2002): 

  * Show the Tiger files PLACE as a city: this happen to be more exact than 
  the county subdivision. As this is a change to buildmap, this requires to 
  rebuild the maps. 

  * Add the keyboard to all dialogs, i.e. to the Preferences dialog as well. 

  * Isolate the GUI toolkit code for the main window: the roadgps and roadmap 
  programs now use an abstracted GUI API, for which a Gtk implementation is 
  provided. 

  * Change the makefiles and the name of the RoadMap's ipk package to allow 
  for other GUI toolkits support.

 Please note that the content of the map files has slightly changed due to 
 these changes. The map files must be regenerated when upgrading RoadMap to 
 version 0.8. 

Roadmap v0.7 (November 24th, 2002): 

  * Add cities which FIPS code was the same in 1990 and 2000. These cities was 
  previously filtered out by mistake. 

  * Add the freeway ramps, which were also not included before. 

  * All symbols shown on the map (GPS position, destination, etc..) are now 
  user-defined. A new configuration file, "sprites", defines the look of these 
  symbols. 

  * The symbols have been redesigned, hopefully these are now more fancy. 

  * The GPS position symbol now indicates the direction of the movement. 

  * RoadMap shows a compass symbol that indicates the direction of the North 
  pole. This is especially useful when the map was rotated. 

  * The configuration files have been reorganized, in part to avoid hardcoding 
  the properties of the objects on the map (streets and others). 

  * The module roadmap_config.c has been reorganized to be more generic and 
  flexible, and to handle the new configuration file organization. 

  * The canvas widget has been abstracted to make RoadMap more portable. This 
  is only one step toward portability: the next steps are to abstract the main 
  window, the dialogs, and then the OS API. 

  * The drawing commands have been buffered to improve performances and to 
  minimize the overhead generated by the abstracted canvas layer. 

  * The trigonometry functions have been replaced with pre-computed tables. 
  This makes it possible to use integers most of the time: only a handful of 
  real values are still used. The rotation code has been reorganized to improve 
  performances. 

  * As a result of the changes above, RoadMap is now faster than before (seems 
  to be 30% faster on an iPAQ 35xx).

 Please note that the format of the map files has slightly changed due to 
 these changes. The map files must be regenerated when upgrading RoadMap to 
 version 0.7. 

Roadmap v0.6 (November 1st, 2002): 

  * This version has been tested on the road with a real GPS (a Garmin 38). 

  * Avoid redrawing the map twice when tracking the GPS position. 

  * Add an "install" target in the make file. 

  * Add a menu description file for Gnome and GPE. 

  * The street name now stays a minimum of 10 seconds on the screen (can be 
  adjusted in the preferences dialog), even while tracking the current GPS 
  position. The selected street block is now indicated by highlighting the two 
  endpoints only (versus the entire line as before). 

  * Preliminary support for the 2002 release of the Tiger files. 

  * Use the popt library for the build tools' line arguments (buildmap, 
  buildus, dumpmap).

Roadmap v0.5.1 (October 23th, 2002): 

  * Provide the URL for AllSt.txt in the README file.

Roadmap v0.5 (October 20th, 2002): 

  * Added support for map rotation. 

  * Defined four screen modes: show destination, fixed location, track GPS 
  with map orientation, track GPS without map orientation. Each mode has its own 
  independent orientation (the 3rd mode being dynamic). 

  * speedup the street search: focus on a limited area around the cursor. 

  * Added launcher for roadgps in roadmap's menus. 

  * A few minor bug fixes.

Roadmap v0.4 (October 13th, 2002): 

  * Added a Gtk GPS console (roadgps) to help debug the GPS interface. 

  * Make roadmap really track the GPS position in realtime. 

  * Did I mention there is now a preference editor? (new in 0.3, actually). 

  * Significant cleanup of the Gtk dependencies, so a port to QT should be 
  possible. 

  * A few more bug fixes.

Roadmap v0.3 (September 29th, 2002): 

  * Added an interface with gpsd: RoadMap now shows the current GPS position 
  when available. 

  * Change the default database path to include the current directory. 

  * A few more bug fixes.

Roadmap v0.2 (September 2nd, 2002): 

  * Handle very large grids (more than 64k squares). 

  * Fixed the 32 bits street numbers bug. 

  * Create intermediate shape points when the existing ones are too far away 
  for a 16 bit delta. 

  * Fix a crash when the current position is out of any known map. 

  * Fix a crash when the city name has a typo. 

  * Save the selected destination and current location in the roadmap session 
  file, so we remember them on the next session. 

  * Changed the RoadMap defaults to make the demo map easy to use.

Roadmap v0.1 (august, 2002): First release of RoadMap.
