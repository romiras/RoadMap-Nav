# Sample "relabeling" file for RoadMap.
#
# The names displayed to represent actions in the RoadMap user
# interface can be modified with a "roadmap.actionlabels" file. 
# (RoadGps can use a similar file:  "roadgps.actionlabels".)
#
# Each action is renamed using one line of text that contains a)
# the action name, b) its menu label, c) its toolbar label and d)
# its "tip", in that order.  Each of these items is separated by
# one special character.  This separator can be any
# non-alphanumeric character.
#
# Different separators can be used on different lines, but the
# separator must be the same across an entire line.
#
# Omitting one of the items leaves it at its default setting --
# so these examples will only change the toolbar label, leaving
# the menu entries and tooltips alone.
