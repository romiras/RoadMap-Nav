# This file describes objects which can be displayed on the screen.
# These objects can reflect the state of the program (e.g., which way
# is north, how strong is the GPS signal), and/or allow actions to
# be performed (e.g. zoom in, show the trip's destination).  These
# objects may be placed anywhere on the screen, but nothing prevents
# them from being obscured by other popup messages and displays, so
# their position should probably be along the sides of the screen.
#
# Syntax:
#
# N <name>              Name of the object (unused, but starts a new object)
#                         Specifying a name, and nothing else at all, will
#                         define a null object which can be used to
#                         override objects defined in other (e.g. system)
#                         screenobjects files.
# P <x> <y>             The screen position of the sprite, measured from
#                         the top left in pixels.  Negative offsets measure
#                         from the right and from the bottom.  If the <x> or
#                         <y> value begins with a 'C', then the remainder
#                         is an offset from the center of the screen.
# E <sprite> [text]       The name of the sprite which will be drawn.
# E <sprite> [text]       Multiple sprites can be specified.  Which one is
#                         displayed is selected via the object's "state"
#                         indicator.  If "text" is specified, it will be
#                         displayed with the sprite (assuming the sprite
#                         has been defined to have text associated with it).
#                          - The text can be divided into multiple lines.
#                            Line breaks are indicated by inserting a '^'.
#                          - The text can contain %-macros, just as defined
#                            for other text displays, in order to display
#                            dynamic content.  The '|' "alternation" symbol
#                            is also honored.  See the documentation.
# S <statename>         The "state" indicator which will choose among 
#                         the listed sprites.  For "constant" displays, this
#                         is optional.
# A <actionname>        The action which should be invoked when the sprite
#                         is selected.  Optional.
# R <angle>             Sprites will normally rotate dynamically, either with
#                         the screen, or based on an angle retrieved via the
#                         state indicator.  Specifying 'R' suppresses this
#                         by forcing rotation to the given angle. (default 0)
# B <x> <y> <x> <y>     Optional -- the bounding box used to determine 
#                         whether a selection has taken place.  (I.e., the
#                         size of the sprite.) Normally the bounding box is
#                         provided by the sprite itself, but irregularly
#                         shaped sprites, combined with the rotation of the
#                         sprite, may require that the box be overridden.
#                         Note that the bounding box for any text associated
#                         with the sprite is calculated and considered
#                         separately.  Also note that if sprite scaling is
#                         used, this bounding box may need to be adjusted.
