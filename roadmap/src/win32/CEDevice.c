/**
 * @file
 * @brief Windows CE power management code
 * @ingroup windows
 *
 * This code uses three techniques :
 * - Call SetPowerRequirement once on the backlight device BLK1: to keep the light on
 * - Periodically call SystemIdleTimerReset to keep the system from powering down
 * - Periodically call SHIdleTimerReset to keep the shell from locking the device or
 *   reverting to the Today screen.
 *
 * Power management code borrowed from MoDaCo & Betaplayer. Thanks !
