 * SYNOPSYS:
 *
 *   int  buildmap_polygon_add_landmark
 *           (int landid, char cfcc, RoadMapString name);
 *   int  buildmap_polygon_add (int landid, RoadMapString cenid, int polyid);
 *   int  buildmap_polygon_add_line
 *           (RoadMapString cenid, int polyid, int tlid, int side);
 *
 *   int  buildmap_polygon_use_line (int tlid);
 *
 * These functions are used to build a table of lines from
 * the Tiger maps. The objective is double: (1) reduce the size of
 * the Tiger data by sharing all duplicated information and
 * (2) produce the index data to serve as the basis for a fast
 * search mechanism for streets in roadmap.
 *
 * This module considers a single area to be described by a unique landmark
 * ID. Each area can be made of multiple polygons, but the name of the area
 * as well as the layer to be used is the same for all the polygons and
 * is defined with the landmark.
 *
 * Thus buildmap_polygon_add_landmark() should be called before
 * buildmap_polygon_add(), which should be called before
 * buildmap_polygon_add_line().
 *
 * The contour of each polygon is defined by a succession of lines. The
 * map file will be filled with the lines in an order that is convenient
 * for drawing. Imagine you would walk around the area following the
 * polygon countour: you would then walk over all lines in a certain
 * order: this is the sorting order there.
 *
 * Of course this order can lead to two solutions: either you walk clockwise
 * or counter clockwise. The code here choose on way arbitrarily. However
 * you can provide the lines in direction, but you must tell which one it is.
 * The direction is defined by the order of the "from" and "to" points: if
 * you were to walk from "from" to "to", would you have the area's polygon
 * on you right or on your left? That information is the purpose of the "side"
 * parameter.
 *
 * Note that polygons must be loaded before the lines. This is because a
 * line must be loaded if it is part of a polygon, even if its layer is
 * normally ignored (a line may not belong to the same layer as the polygon:
 * think of a city park which half bounding lines are streets and the other
 * half are property lines--RoadMap would normally not load property lines).
 *
 * The function buildmap_polygon_use_line() tells the line loading logic
 * if it must load the line anyway.
 *
 * The other functions are generic functions, same as for the other table
 * modules.
