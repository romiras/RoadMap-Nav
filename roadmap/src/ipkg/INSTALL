INTRODUCTION

   This document describes the installation of RoadMap, a car navigation
   system, on an ARM-powered PDA running Familiar Linux and the GPE
   graphic environment.

BEFORE THE INSTALL

* Removing any prior installation of RoadMap

   The path to the maps has changed. In addition there is no more package
   for the maps (the maps are too big for that and there was only one example
   map anyway). Therefore the roadmap-sfca package should be removed first

----
   ipkg remove roadmap-sfca
----

   The name of the RoadMap package has also changed from roadmap-gtk2 to
   roadmap. Therefore the roadmap-gtk2 package should be removed:

----
   ipkg remove roadmap-gtk2
----


* Making room for RoadMap

   On a PDA with 32Mb of RAM, GPE takes most of the available space and less
   than 2Mb of RAM is left available. For RoadMap to work one need to make
   some room. The author recommends removing xstroke and the GPE help from
   the bottom panel.

   Another problem is a bug in the Familiar X server that causes the file
   ~/.xsession-errors to grow infinitely in the ramdisk, eating up all the
   available RAM in a matter of days.
   
   The work-around is to not start the ipaq-sleep daemon. To do this,
   comment out the line "/etc/init.d/ipaq-sleep start" in the file:

----
           /etc/X11/Xsession.d/69ipaq-sleep
----


* Installing gpsd

   RoadMap depends on gpsd for receiving data from the GPS device. Therefore
   the gpsd package must be installed:

----
   ipkg install gpsd
----

   Once this has been done, the serial line must be configured for using gpsd
   (see the serial line configuration tool in the Settings folder).


INSTALLING ROADMAP

   There are three steps: first install the RoadMap package, then install
   some maps and last setup your preferences if you installed RoadMap in
   a custom way.


* Installing the package

   There is very little to say here. RoadMap takes less than 300Kb of space,
   uncompressed. It installs itself in /usr/bin and /usr/share/pixmaps:

----
   ipkg install roadmap                 (if your feed provides RoadMap)
   ipkg install roadmap_X.Y.Z_arm.ipk   (if you transfered the package)
----


* Installing maps

   The RoadMap package is preconfigured for maps stored either in a MMC, SD or
   CompactFlash (CF) card. The map files must be installed in a subdirectory
   of the device's root directory named "share/roadmap". The reason for that
   is to follow standard UNIX convention and make it easier to store other
   types of data in the device (such as MP3 files).

   The file system used for the device is indifferent (RoadMap maps complies
   with the 8+3 limitation of the FAT file system) but VFAT is recommended
   (if only because this is the factory default file system..).

   The map files can be retrieved from any of the RoadMap sites:

       * {{http://roadmap.saignon.net}}

       * {{http://roadmap.noscience.net}}

   The first file to install in the share/roadmap subdirectory is the file
   named "usdir.rdm". This file is mandatory: this is the index used to
   retrieve all other map files. All other files are optional: one can load
   a limited subset of maps only. If a map is not available, RoadMap will
   issue a warning message on the screen.


* Setting the user preferences

   Start Roadmap, select <<File / Preferences>>. The preferences dialog is
   made of a (long) serie of tabbed screens. Most preferences do not need
   to be modified.
