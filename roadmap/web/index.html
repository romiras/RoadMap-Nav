<H1>A Car Navigation System for Linux and UNIX (and PocketPC too)</H1>
</CENTER>
<BR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The following is a short description of RoadMap. More information is
available in the <a class="normal" href="documentation.html">documentation</a>
distributed with RoadMap.

<P>RoadMap is an open source (GPL) program that provides a car navigation for
Linux, UNIX and now Windows CE (a.k.a. PocketPC).
It displays a map of the streets, tracks the position provided by a
NMEA-compliant GPS receiver, identifies the street matching this GPS position
and announces the name of the crossing street at the next intersection. A
trip feature allows RoadMap to display routes, tracks, and provide some
basic navigation information (distance to the next waypoint, direction,
speed, etc..).  Voice messages are generated that duplicate some of the
screen information.

<P>It is possible to display a specific area by providing a (complete or
incomplete) postal address, the intersection of two streets or an exact
position (longitude / latitude).

<P>Most of the map files used by RoadMap are generated from the TIGER files
provided by the US Census Bureau, and from the RNF files provided by
Statistics Canada, and thus cover northern North America only.  There
has been recent work on deriving RoadMap data from other sources,
including postgis and other shapefile-based formats, but this work
is either not on the main development branch, or very experimental.

<P>RoadMap has been designed to be usable on both a desktop or laptop PC, 
or on a PDA such as the iPAQ from HP (formely from COMPAQ). It can use either
the Gtk 1.2 , Gtk 2.0 or QT (QT3 or QT4) graphic library for its user
interface.  The Qt interface supports the Sharp's Zaurus PDA.  All these
machines share the same endianness and can use the maps provided on this
site.

<P>The on-screen user interface is very customizable.  All command actions
can be bound to arbitrary menu entries, toolbar buttons, or
on-screen icon-like sprites.  (Some actions are also bound to keystrokes,
but this binding is currently fixed.) The menu layout and the
toolbar position and layout can be changed.  Popup menus are
available (activated by another menu or toolbar button, a
right-click, or a long-click).  All of these can be used at once,
or a minimalist configuration can consist of a screen containing
nothing but a map.  In that case, a long- or right-click can bring up the
"master popup menu".

<P>At this time there are no routing features implemented in the main
codebase.  The plan for the future is to implement some navigation features
similar to those found in commercial street navigation systems.  The main
limit for implementing routing is the lack of navigation information in the
US Census Bureau database (for example one-way street are not indicated). 
The US Census Bureau has clearly indicated that it does not plan to add
these information in the future (the USCB does not need them).  The RoadMap
"editor" project, maintained by Ehud Shabtai, does support navigation --
the data used in that project supports the feature.

<P>RoadMap usually uses
<a class="normal" href="http://gpsd.berlios.de">gpsd</a>
for the GPS link and can use
<a class="normal" href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/">flite</a>
(festival lite) for the voice messages.

<P>RoadMap comes with its own GPS status screen ("RoadGPS"), which provides
an overview of the satellites received and highlights those the GPS has a
fix on.  This status screen allows for placing the GPS device in a position
that optimizes satellite reception, even if that means making the GPS
device's screen not accessible.  Obviously it's also useful with
"displayless" GPS units.

<P>RoadMap uses a binary file format for representing the maps that is compact 
enough to allow the storage of many maps on a Compact Flash or MultiMedia card. 
For example, the map of Los Angeles county takes about 10 Mbytes of flash
space. RoadMap comes with a set of tools to convert the US Census bureau data
(both the 2000 and 2002 versions) into its own map format. Future versions of
the US Census bureau data will be supported as well (usually a 1 or 2 months
after the data has been released).

<P>When RoadMap starts, it displays a map of the same area that was displayed
on the latest session. Clicking on the map screen triggers a "sign" that
displays the name of the street, road or freeway (if any) that is the closest
to the mouse hotpoint.

The original RoadMap was (and still is) developed by Pascal
Martin.  As of 2007, Paul Fox has taken over as "maintainer of
the moment".  A version of RoadMap for the Sharp Zaurus was
developed by Latchesar Ionkov (who wrote the original QT
support).  The support for the Digital Charts of the World was
contributed by Stephen Woodbridge.  The version of RoadMap for
Windows (PocketPC) is developed and supported by Ehud Shabtai
(eshabtai at gmail dot com).  Paul Fox has added GPX data
interchange support for trips, routes, landmark, and
points-of-interest.  Ehud and Paul have added street labeling and
other features as well.  Alex Briosi and Oleg Gusev contributed
the QT4 desktop port.
