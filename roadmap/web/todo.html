<P>This page lists the changes planned for the next version of RoadMap. Please
feel free to contact the author for more ideas.
<P>
Now that RoadMap 1.0 has been released, a 1.1 development branch will be
started, with the highest priority given to some needed changes to the map
format. This means there will be no map provided for the 1.1 branch,
considering their unstable nature. The 1.0 branch will be maintained as
the "stable" branch. Some of the changes above may still find their way
in the stable branch, as long as map compatibility is maintained. It may
take some time before the development branch appears on the web site,
depending on how many bugs are discovered in the stable version.
<P>
When 1.1 will become stable, a 1.2 stable branch will be created and
an 1.3 development branch will be started anew, and so on.
<P>
(The changes believed to break compatibility with RoadMap 1.0 are marked
with a "[1.1]" sign.)
<P>
Here is the detail description of the changes planned so far:
<UL>
  <LI><b>More natural street naming</b>. RoadMap requires the street names to
  be entered using the US Census Bureau's own conventions (ST for streets, AVE
  for avenues and so on..). It would be more friendly to authorize some
  alternate conventions (such as AV for avenues), or even plain words. The
  idea would be to let the user set a list of aliases for each USCB acronym.
  These aliases would be stored in a text file loaded either from the user's
  environment, or else from the shared one.

  <LI><b>Separate street geocoding code from the address dialog module</b>.
  The localization of a street address involves some significant logic that
  is today included in the code that manages the address dialog. Finding the
  position of a given address (aka geocoding) should be possible without
  depending on a GUI feature.

  <LI><b>File dialogs are too large for PDA screens</b>. RoadMap was once
  converted so to use the standard toolkit file dialogs. This is a problem
  with small PDA screens, as some toolkits (namely the GTK 1 and 2 ones)
  were designed for larger screens and do not fit in an iPAQ one. The solution
  might be to implement a GPE version of RoadMap, as GPE is the standard
  GTK-based graphic environment for the iPAQ.

  <LI><b>Merge street number ranges</b>. The US Census Bureau database
  has separate street ranges for the left and right sides of each street
  block. When both sides have matching ranges (for example 1020 - 1090 and
  1021 - 1091), a lot of space could be saved by merging then in a single range
  (such as 1020 - 1091). At that time, RoadMap does not use the "side" info
  anyway. Not that this change would modify the data contained in the map
  files, but not the organization, so the resulting maps should be compatible
  with RoadMap 1.0.

  <LI><b>Use icons on the toolbar (at least)</b>. The RoadMap toolbar is
  made of text labels only, mostly because I was too lazzy for anything more
  complicated. Darrick Hartman has proposed to create some icons.

  <LI><b>[1.1] Use GPS time and map's timezone</b>. The GPS receiver provides a
  reliable universal time as well as the current location. This is all what
  RoadMap needs to show the correct local time:
  <UL>
    <LI>Associate a timezone to each county.
    <LI>When showing a particular location on the map, display the local time
    for this location.
    <LI>Show estimated time of arrival in the destination's timezone.
   </UL>
   One might think of setting the UNIX time and system timezone, but that
   would be a bad idea: this would cause a whole mess when replaying GPS logs,
   RoadMap would need to be root or have the set UID bit set and managing
   system setup is best left to system daemons.

  <LI><b>[1.1] Modular map format</b>. RoadMap map format is such today that all
  the information must be contained in a single file. RoadMap should be
  able to display, and use, data from multiple county files. The benefits
  are that one can come with his own additional information (such as
  railroad tracks) without modifying the existing maps or making them larger.
  In addition the current set of maps could be cut in two (separating the
  street shapes from the street names) to lower the amount of data mapped by
  RoadMap when displaying the map on the screen (especially when zoomed out).

  <LI><b>[1.1] Modular map rendering</b>. the RoadMap map rendering code
  should be made more modular so that a new type of data can be defined,
  associated with a plugin to implement the rendering code.

  <LI><b>Track more than one GPS source</b>. RoadMap should allow the user
  to track alternate GPS sources as defined by the user (like GpsDrive's
  friendsd).

  <LI><b>Interface with address book applications</b>. RoadMap should be
  able to interface with address book databases to get street addresses
  from there. Instead of specifying a destination address, one would
  provide the name of a person.
