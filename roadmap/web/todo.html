<P>This page lists the changes planned for the future versions of RoadMap.
Please feel free to contact the author for more ideas.
<P>
When the developments on RoadMap 1.0 are complete, a 1.1 development branch
will be started, with the highest priority given to some needed changes to
the map format. The criteria for starting the 1.1 branch is actually the
compatibility with the existing maps: RoadMap will stay at the 1.0 level as
long as the format of the maps has not changed.
<P>
This means there will be no map provided for the 1.1 branch, considering
their unstable nature. The 1.0 branch will be maintained as the "stable"
branch. Some of the changes above may still find their way in the stable
branch, as long as the map compatibility is maintained. It may take some
time before the development branch appears on the web site.
<P>
When the 1.1 code will stabilize, a new 1.2 stable branch will be created and
a 1.3 development branch will be started anew, and so on.
<P>
(The changes believed to break compatibility with RoadMap 1.0 are marked
with a "[1.1]" sign.)
<P>
Here is the detail description of the changes planned so far:
<UL>
  <LI><b>Error messages on screen</b>. The error messages are logged on
  the standard output, and to individual dialog boxes.  Standard output
  isn't very useful in a GUI app, and the dialog boxes can multiply
  much too fast with recurring errors. Some sort of an "error log" window
  would be a good compromise.

  One issue is fonts: should be big enough to be readable in a car.

  <LI><b>Use checkbox widget in the menus and toolbars</b>. Some menu and
  toolbar entries are of the "start & stop" kind. Instead of having 2 entries
  it would be nice to use a single checkbox one.  Other entries are already
  toggles, but their state can't be determined visually.

  <LI><b>A "busy" indicator</b>.  Some commands and screen refresh
  operations can take a long time, depending on the hardware, and the
  speed of the connection to the PC (in the case of ssh, remote X11,
  VNC, etc).  A busy hourglass, or other indication that RoadMap is not
  yet ready for a new command, would be useful.

  <LI><b>More message formats, and message data</b>  Users have requested
  that more types of data be available on-screen:
  <OL>
    <LI>speed should be available all the time, not just when a
    route is active
    <LI> course (bearing), altitude
    <LI> wallclock, and elapsed, and projected "trip time"
    <LI> distance traveled since program start
    <LI> distance since route start
    <LI> perhaps a shell escape, for getting data from external programs?
  </OL>
  In addition message signs that are too long should wrap, rather than
  truncate.
  <LI><b>Key bindings should be rebindable by the user.</b>This would
  make the UI fully customizable.

  <LI><b>Show GPS location and speed</b>. The speed shows on RoadMap, but
  not on RoadGps. The location shows on none. There should be a way to show
  the location, at least in RoadGps.

  <LI><b>Show when the GPS source is not available</b>. RoadMap gives no
  feedback regarding its connection to the GPS source. The feedback should
  be somewhat graphical (an icon?) and not a dialog (in a car?).

  <LI><b>[1.1] Use GPS time and map's timezone</b>. The GPS receiver provides a
  reliable universal time as well as the current location. This is all what
  RoadMap needs to show the correct local time:
  <UL>
    <LI>Associate a timezone to each county.
    <LI>When showing a particular location on the map, display the local time
    for this location.
    <LI>Show estimated time of arrival in the destination's timezone.
  </UL>
  One might think of setting the UNIX time and system timezone, but that
  would be a bad idea: this would cause a whole mess when replaying GPS logs,
  RoadMap would need to be root or have the set UID bit set and managing
  system setup is best left to system daemons. In addition, gpsd is now
  synchronizing the system time, so don't mess with that subject..

  <LI><b>[1.1] Modular map format</b>. RoadMap map format is such today that all
  the information must be contained in a single file. RoadMap should be
  able to display, and use, data from multiple county files. The benefits
  are that one can come with his own additional information (such as
  railroad tracks) without modifying the existing maps or making them larger.
  In addition the current set of maps could be cut in two (separating the
  street shapes from the street names) to lower the amount of data mapped by
  RoadMap when displaying the map on the screen (especially when zoomed out).
  Essentially, layers could be assigned to each of the split-up county files.

  <LI><b>[1.1] Modular map rendering</b>. the RoadMap map rendering code
  should be made more modular so that a new type of data can be defined,
  associated with a plugin to implement the rendering code.

  <LI><b>Track more than one GPS source</b>. RoadMap should allow the user
  to track alternate GPS sources as defined by the user (like GpsDrive's
  friendsd).

  <LI><b>Navigation</b>.  While the TIGER data doesn't have the necessary
  data to make navigation with RoadMap feasible currently, other datasets
  do, and the roadmap_editor branch has proven that it can be done.
  OpenStreetMap is starting to work with TIGER maps, and perhaps that
  work can be used as a shared resource for adding the necessary meta-data.

  <LI><b>Places</b>.  Work was begun to add "places" support (i.e. landmark)
  names to the RoadMap database.  This should be finished.

  <LI><b>Interface with address book applications</b>. RoadMap should be
  able to interface with address book databases to get street addresses
  from there. Instead of specifying a destination address, one would
  provide the name of a person.

  <LI><b>Cross-platform widgets</b>.  While the current home-grown widgets work
  pretty well, it's probably time to implement a version of the RoadMap
  API in something like WxWidgets.  If this were successful, and the extra
  cost of such a widget set weren't too great, then over time we could
  switch to it exclusively.
