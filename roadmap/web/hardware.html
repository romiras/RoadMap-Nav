<HR>
<P>The intend of this page is to establish a list of equipment known to work
with RoadMap. The list is still short, mostly because the page has just been
established.
<P>This page includes links to manufacturer's product pages. This site
has no commercial agreement and made no advertisement deal with the vendors.
These links are provided for technical information purpose only.
<P> Please do not hesitate to share your experience by sending an e-mail
to the <a class="normal" href="list.html">RoadMap mailing list</a>.
<P>It is expected that RoadMap will work with most NMEA-compatible GPS
receivers. A frequent source of compatibility problem is the support for
USB devices in the Linux kernel, as some GPS USB receivers do not seem
to use a standard USB communication device model.
