<P>WARNING: RoadMap is not yet capable of handling all US counties,
due to a handful of bugs. Here are the details:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The generation of the following RoadMap map files generate errors for the 
  following counties: 02110, 51095, 51830. This seems to be a problem with the 
  Tiger/Line 2002 data (duplicated records, most likely an erroneous TLID). The 
  problem has been worked around more or less for now.
  <P><b>Latest News</b>:
  the US Census Bureau has fixed several duplicated line ID, making changes to
  7 counties. My choice so far is to not update the RoadMap maps: the 2003
  release of the TIGER map database has been announced and the RoadMap map
  files will be regenerated in full then.</LI>
  <LI>The maps for the state of Hawaii do not use the NAD83 datum. The offset
  can be significant (a few hundred feet), making these maps basically unusable
  for navigation. The USGS bureau has announced that their maps of hawaii are
  being redone using the NAD83 datum, lets hope the US Census Bureau will do
  the same.
</UL>
<P>RoadMap known bugs: 
<UL>
  <LI>On the HP iPAQ, and possibly on other PDA as well, RoadMap sometime
  becomes sluggish and process X events after a significant delay. There is
  not yet an explanation for this behavior. <em>This might have been fixed in
  1.0rc9</em>
  <LI>When tracking the GPS position with a trip started, if one use the
  arrows to move the vehicule's sprite to the side, then the direction
  (red) arrow goes the other way.
  <LI>It seems that RoadMap has some memory leaks problems: playing the
  same trip log over and over causes the size of the RoadMap process to
  grow.
  <LI>Search of a city is broken: cities and places are confused. This makes
  it difficult to find some cities.
  <LI>The buildus tool does not use the map path: it assumes all the map files 
  are in the same directory. 
  <LI>The Tiger files define polygons as delineated by a list of lines. Any of 
  these lines might be defined by a serie of shape points. RoadMap uses the 
  shape points when drawing the lines, but not when filling the polygons. 
  <LI>The "address by ZIP" method does not work anymore since the automatic 
  selection of the map was implemented, because the file usdir.rdm does not
  have any ZIP code location information (TBD) yet. This feature has been
  hidden from the user interface for now. 
  <LI>Some street numbers include letters, which is not well supported by 
  RoadMap: in such a case, roadmap generates a street number which is hoped to 
  be unique enough by converting the letter into a "number", with a few twist
  to handle some "geoposition" address formats. This is a design problem that
  is not going to be solved any time soon. Current kludge is deemed good enough
  for the time being, until someone give a practical case where this does not
  work. 
  <LI>Street address conflicts appear when building maps. Some seems to 
  be a TIGER map database problem (see above). Others might be caused by the
  address range format issue (see below). A few still need to be investigated.
  <LI>Some urban areas are missing. For example Woodland Hills (in Los Angeles 
  county). This may be a TIGER file problem: the string "WOODLAND HILLS" never 
  appears in the LA county files. </LI></UL>
