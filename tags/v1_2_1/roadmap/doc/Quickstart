RoadMap Quickstart

January 2009

= Quickstart =

   This section describes the most basic steps you'll need to perform
   in order to get RoadMap running on your system.  More detailed
   information is available in the Installation Guide section of the
   documentation.

   To build RoadMap for a "standard" linux/unix environment, follow
   the following steps:

     - Read the commentary in "config.mk", and edit the values there
       to select your build options.  For most users, no other
       configuration choices should be necessary.
       
     - Run "make".  (RoadMap requires GNU make, and may require gcc).
       
     - Run "make install".  This will install the executables as well
       as important data files.  It will _not_ install any map data,
       however.  At this point you should be able to run "roadmap",
       but it will tell you there are no maps.

     - To test drive RoadMap for the first time, download the
       "demo" maps from:

         http://roadmap.digitalomaha.net/maps/demo_maps.tar.gz

       This tarball contains state outlines for all of the continental
       USA, plus the detailed map of San Francisco county.  Unpack
       this file somewhere convenient, e.g. /tmp/demo_maps.

     - Start RoadMap, specifying the path that you chose above:

```
        roadmap --maps=/tmp/demo_maps
```

       Use the arrow keys (or drag with the mouse) to pan, and use the
       on-screen controls or the '+' and '-' keys to zoom.  RoadMap's
       help text is available in html format via the Help menu (which
       reads the installed copy of "usermanual.html") or in plaintext in
       the README file.  Use the 'q' key or the File->Quit menu
       item to quit.

     - When you're ready to download a more complete set of maps, get
       them from

         http://roadmap.sourceforge.net/maps.html

       Be sure to get the master index file in addition to any maps
       you may need.  Unpack these into a more permanent home than
       before -- under "/var/lib/roadmap", or in your home directory,
       under "~/.roadmap/maps".  If you choose a different directory
       than either of these, you'll need to navigate to the "Map"
       preferences panel (File-->Preferences->Map), and enter the 
       chosen path as Map.Path.


   For more complete installation and configuration information,
   please consult the "INSTALLATION" section of the README file.
   The README is on the web, here:

   Good luck, and have fun!
