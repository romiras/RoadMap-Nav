City search is broken:

   The roadmap files include a table to convert a place into a
   county subdivision. This table causes a lot of problems because
   places can span across county subdivisions, with name clashes.

The buildus tool does not use the regular map path:

   The buildus tool does not use the map path: it assumes all the map
   files are in the same directory.

Shape point are ignored when drawing polygons:

   The Tiger files define polygons as delineated by a list of lines.
   Any of these lines might be defined by a serie of shape points.

   RoadMap uses the shape points when drawing the lines, but not when
   filling the polygons.

The "address by ZIP" method does not work anymore:

   Since the automatic selection of the map, because the file usdir.rdm
   does not have yet any ZIP code location information (TBD).

   This feature has been hidden from the user interface  for now.

Street address conflicts:

   A few street address conflicts appears when building maps. Some seems
   to be a TIGER map database problem. Others might be caused by the address
   range format issue (see below). A few still need to be investigated.

   NOTE: 3 of these addresses conflicts have been confirmed to be TIGER
   database errors by the census bureau.

Street numbers are not always numerical:

   Some street numbers include letters, which is not well supported by RoadMap:
   in such a case, roadmap generates a street number which is hoped to be
   unique enough by converting the letter into a "number".

   This is a design problem that is not going to be solved any time soon.
   Current kludge is deemed good enough for the time being, until someone
   give a practical case where this does not work.

Some urban areas are missing:

   For example: Woodland Hills (in Los Angeles county).
   This is a TIGER file problem: the string "WOODLAND HILLS" never appears
   in the LA county files.
