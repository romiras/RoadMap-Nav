roadmap (1.0.8-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #276135)
  * Selected the Gtk version, as this is the version actively
    maintained by the author.  To build the Qt version, the
    build-dependencies should change to 'libqt3-compat-headers,
    libqt3-dev | libqt3-mt-dev'.
  * Set the default help browser to sensible-browser instead of dillo
    (40_help_browser.dpatch).
