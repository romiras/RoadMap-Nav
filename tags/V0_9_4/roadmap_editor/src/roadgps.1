.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
A very handy GPS console, inspired by the Garmin satellite status
page, with a NMEA log capability.  Thanks to gpsd, roadgps and roadmap
can be active at the same time. The roadgps program was intended to be
started from the roadmap menu.

.PP
More information is available in the RoadMap online help.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
Most options may also be set as preferences. In fact, when an option matches
a preferences item, using the option does modify the preferences item as well.
As a consequence the effect of theses options will be permanent until the same
option is used again or the associated preference item has been changed.
Because the same preferences are used by \fBroadmap\fR and \fBroadgps\fR,
using any of those options with one program will impact the other.

.PP
An option with no associated preference item behaves in a more traditional
way, i.e. its effect is valid for that command only.

.TP
\fB\-\-location=\fIlongitude\fR,\fIlatitude\fR\fR
Set the current location point (see menu entry View/Show Location..).
Preference item: \fBLocations.Location\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-metric\fR
Use the metric system for all units.
Preference item: \fBGeneral.Unit = metric\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-imperial\fR
Use the imperial system for all units.
Preference item: \fBGeneral.Unit = imperial\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-geometry\fR[\fB:\fIwindow\fR\fR]\fB=\fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR\fR
Set the geometry of a specific RoadMap window, identified by it's title. If
no window title is provided, this defines the geometry of the main window.
If the window's title includes any space, dashes can be used in place of
the spaces (the goal here is to be shell friendly).
Preference item: \fBGeometry.\fIwindow\fR\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-toolbar\fR
Do not show the toolbar.
Preference item: \fBGeneral.Toolbar = no\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-icon\fR
Do not show any icon (presumably to keep as much space as possible for
the map).
Preference item: \fBGeneral.Icons = no\R.

.TP
\fB\-\-gps=\fIurl\fR\fR
Use the specified GPS source. Two URL formats only are supported:
"gpsd://\fIhost\fR/" (access the GPS through a gpsd server) and
"file://\fIpath\fR" or "\fIpath\fR" (\fIpath\fR must be a full path).
As an exception, this option is \fInot\fR sticky: it does override
the related preferences item, but the preferences are not modified.
The main rational for this behavior is to make it painless to replay GPS logs.

.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR[\fB=\fIsource\fR\fR]
Print debug messages. If a source file is provided, only debug messages
generated from that source file are printed.

.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Enable some log messages (a subset of the debug messages).

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Show a description of the program options and quit.

.SH "BUGS"
.LP 
The \fBroadgps\fR program should really not decode all the \fBroadmap\fR
command line options, some of which have no effect on \fBroadgps\fR.
