The files in this gpx subdirectory are derived from the code for
the excellent GPS data translation and filtering program called
GPSBabel, available at http://www.gpsbabel.org.  The starting
point for the code here was at roughly their release level 1.2.8. 
The changes made here were to allow more flexible access to the
route and waypoint data structures, and to reduce the codesize as
a benefit of only supporting GPX format. 

(The other big difference between this and the current gpsbabel
code is the absence here of the more sophisticated foreign
character set translation that gpsbabel has in their cet
subdirectory -- we use the more primitive 1.2.7 character
translation.)
