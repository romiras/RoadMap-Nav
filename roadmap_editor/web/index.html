<P>
The original RoadMap was (and still is) developped by Pascal Martin (pascal
dot martin at iname dot com). A version of RoadMap for the Sharp Zaurus was
developped by Latchesar Ionkov (who wrote the original QT support). The
support for the Digital Charts of the World was contributed by Stephen
Woodbridge. The version of RoadMap for Windows (PocketPC) is developped and
supported by Ehud Shabtai (eshabtai at gmail dot com).
<P>
The latest Roadmap sources are also available from <A class=normal
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/roadmap/">Sourceforge's CVS</A>.

<P>The following is a short description of RoadMap. More information is
available in the <a class="normal" href="documentation.html">documentation</a>
distributed with RoadMap.

<P>RoadMap is an open source (GPL) program that provides a car navigation for
Linux, UNIX and now Windows CE (a.k.a. PocketPC).
It displays a map of the streets, tracks the position provided by a
NMEA-compliant GPS receiver, identifies the street matching this GPS position
and announces the name of the crossing street at the next intersection. A
rudimentary trip feature allows RoadMap to display some basic navigation
information (distance to the destination, direction, speed, etc..). Voice
messages are generated that duplicate some of the screen information.

<P>It is possible to display a specific area by providing a (complete or
incomplete) postal address, the intersection of two streets or an exact
position (longitude / latitude).

<P>The map files used by RoadMap are generated from the TIGER files provided
by the US Census Bureau, and thus cover the USA only.  The RoadMap map format
is a binary format that is sensitive to the endianness of the processor. Maps
available on this site cover all the USA and have been generated for a little
endian processor (such as the Intel Pentium and StrongARM processors).

<P>RoadMap has been designed to be usable on both a desktop or laptop PC, 
or on a PDA such as the iPAQ from HP (formely from COMPAQ). It can use either
the Gtk 1.2 , Gtk 2.0 or QT graphic library for its user interface. The Qt
interface supports the Sharp's Zaurus PDA. All these machines share the same
endianness and can use the maps provided on this site.

<P>RoadMap is at an early stage of development. At this time there are no 
routing features implemented yet. The plan for the future is to implement
some navigation features similar to those found in commercial street
navigation systems.  The main limit for implementing routing is the lack of
navigation information in the US Census Bureau database (for example one-way
street are not indicated). The US Census Bureau has clearly indicated that
it does not plan to add these information in the future (the USCB does
not need them).

<P>RoadMap uses <b>gpsd</b> for the GPS link and <a class="normal"
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/">flite</a> (festival lite) for
the voice messages. Note that flite can be rebuilt with better voices than
the default one (such as a US voice instead of a british one--some may
disagree :). See the flite README for more information. Here is an example,
courtesy of Scot Wilcoxon:

<listing>
   cd flite
   make clean    # to remove old executable files
   ./configure --with-vox=cmu_us_kal16
</listing>

<P>RoadMap comes with its own GPS status screen, which provides an overview of 
the satellites received and highlights those the GPS has a fix on. This status 
screen allows for placing the GPS device in a position that optimizes satellite 
reception, even if that means making the GPS device's screen not accessible. 

<P>RoadMap uses a binary file format for representing the maps that is compact 
enough to allow the storage of many maps on a Compact Flash or MultiMedia card. 
For example, the map of Los Angeles county takes about 10 Mbytes of flash
space. RoadMap comes with a set of tools to convert the US Census bureau data
(both the 2000 and 2002 versions) into its own map format. Future versions of
the US Census bureau data will be supported as well (usually a 1 or 2 months
after the data has been released).

<P>When RoadMap starts, it displays a map of the same area that was displayed
on the latest session. Clicking on the map screen triggers a "sign" that
displays the name of the street, road or freeway (if any) that is the closest
to the mouse hotpoint.
