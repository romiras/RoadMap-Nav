<P>WARNING: the Roadmap tool is not yet capable of handling all US counties, due 
to a handful of bugs. The list of counties not properly handled is as follow: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The generation of the following RoadMap map files generate errors for the 
  following counties: 02110, 51095, 51830. This seems to be a problem with the 
  Tiger/Line 2002 data (duplicated records, most likely an erroneous TLID). The 
  problem has been worked around more or less for now. </LI>
</UL>
<P>RoadMap known bugs: 
<UL>
  <LI>Search of a city is broken: cities and places are confused. This make it difficult
  to find some cities.
  <LI>The buildus tool does not use the map path: it assumes all the map files 
  are in the same directory. 
  <LI>The Tiger files define polygons as delineated by a list of lines. Any of 
  these lines might be defined by a serie of shape points. RoadMap uses the 
  shape points when drawing the lines, but not when filling the polygons. 
  <LI>The "address by ZIP" method does not work anymore since the automatic 
  selection of the map was implemented, because the file usdir.rdm does not have 
  yet any ZIP code location information (TBD). This feature has been hidden from 
  the user interface for now. 
  <LI>Some street numbers include letters, which is not well supported by 
  RoadMap: in such a case, roadmap generates a street number which is hoped to 
  be unique enough by converting the letter into a "number", with a few twist to 
  handle some "geoposition" address formats. This is a design problem that is 
  not going to be solved any time soon. Current kludge is deemed good enough for 
  the time being, until someone give a practical case where this does not work. 
  <LI>A few street address conflicts appears when building maps. Some seems to 
  be a TIGER map database problem. Others might be caused by the address range 
  format issue (see below). A few still need to be investigated. NOTE: 3 of 
  these addresses conflicts have been confirmed to be TIGER database errors by 
  the census bureau. 
  <LI>Some urban areas are missing. For example Woodland Hills (in Los Angeles 
  county). This may be a TIGER file problem: the string "WOODLAND HILLS" never 
  appears in the LA county files. </LI></UL>
