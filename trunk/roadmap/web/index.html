<P>RoadMap is a program for street (and car) navigation on Linux. It displays
a street map, can track the position provided by a NMEA-compliant GPS receiver
and identifies the current street that matches this position. A rudimentary
trip feature allows RoadMap to display some basic navigation information
(distance to the destination, direction, speed, etc..). Voice messages are
generated that duplicate some of the screen information.

<P>The map files used by RoadMap are generated from the TIGER files provided
by the US Census Bureau, and thus cover the USA only.  The RoadMap map format
is a binary format that is sensitive to the endianness of the processor. Maps
available on this site cover all the USA and have been generated for a little
endian processor (such as the Intel Pentium and StrongARM processors).

<P>RoadMap has been designed to be usable on both a desktop or laptop PC, 
or on a PDA such as the iPAQ from HP (formely from COMPAQ). It can use either
the Gtk 1.2 , Gtk 2.0 or QT graphic library for its user interface. The Qt
interface supports the Sharp's Zaurus PDA (see above). These machines can
all use the maps provided on this site.

<P>RoadMap is at an early stage of development. At this time there are no 
routing features implemented yet. The plan for the future is to implement
some navigation features similar to those found in commercial street
navigation systems.  The main limit for implementing routing is the lack of
navigation information in the US Census Bureau database (for example one-way
street are not indicated). The US Census Bureau has clearly indicated that
it does not plan to add these information in the future (the USCB does
not need them).

<P>RoadMap uses <b>gpsd</b> for the GPS link and <b>flite</b> for the voice
messages.

<P>RoadMap comes with its own GPS status screen, which provides an overview of 
the satellites received and highlights those the GPS has a fix on. This status 
screen allows for placing the GPS device in a position that optimizes satellite 
reception, even if that means making the GPS device's screen not accessible. 

<P>RoadMap uses a binary file format for representing the maps that is compact 
enough to allow the storage of many maps on a Compact Flash or MultiMedia card. 
For example, the map of Los Angeles county takes about 10 Mbytes of flash
space. RoadMap comes with a set of tools to convert the US Census bureau data
(both the 2000 and 2002 versions) into its own map format. Future versions of
the US Census bureau data will be supported as well (usually a 1 or 2 months
after the data has been released).

<P>When RoadMap starts, it displays a map of the same area that was displayed
on the latest session. Clicking on the map screen triggers a "sign" that
displays the name of the street, road or freeway (if any) that is the closest
to the mouse hotpoint. On the iPAQ the "calendar" button is used to zoom in,
the "telephone" button is used to zoom out, the arrow buttons are used to move
the map and the Compaq ("menu") button is used as "quit".

<P>It is possible to display a specific area by providing a (complete or
incomplete) postal address, the intersection of two streets or an exact
position (longitude / latitude).

<P>When entering a street name, the street prefix, suffix and type, if
provided, must be among the abbreviations listed by the US Census Bureau
(N for north, E for east, Blvd for boulevard, etc..). In almost all cases
these conventions follow the usual abbreviations, so there is no need to
worry here. In addition, any of the fields above is optional: not providing
all of them only makes the search less selective. If several matches are found,
RoadMap shows a list of all matching streets and lets the user select the
appropriate one. 

<P>The exact format of a complete street name as expected by RoadMap is as
follows: 
<P>
<CENTER>[<I>prefix</I> ' '] <I>name</I> [[' ' <I>suffix</I>] ' ' 
<I>type</I>]</CENTER>

<P>It is also possible to omit the street number, or to search around a given 
city (prefix the city name with character '?'). These options have the effect
of making the search even broader. 

<P>More information is available in the README file distributed with RoadMap.
