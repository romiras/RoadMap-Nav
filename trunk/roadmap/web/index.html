<P>RoadMap is a program for Linux that displays street maps. The maps are 
provided by the US Census Bureau, and thus only cover the US. 
<P>RoadMap has been designed to be usable on both a desktop or laptop computer, 
or on a PDA such as the iPAQ from HP (formely from COMPAQ). It uses the Gtk 1.2 
graphic library for its user interface. A Qt interface is planned as well, so 
that RoadMap could be used on the Sharp's Zaurus PDA. 
<P>RoadMap is at an early stage of development. At this time there are no 
routing features implemented yet. RoadMap can only display the map around a 
specified street address or follow a GPS device (using gpsd). The plan for the 
future is to implement some navigation features similar to those found in 
commercial street navigation systems. 
<P>RoadMap comes with its own GPS status screen, which provides an overview of 
the satellites received and highlight those the GPS has a fix on. This status 
screen allows for placing the GPS device in a position that optimizes satellite 
reception, even if that means making the GPS device's screen not accessible. 
<P>RoadMap uses a binary file format for representing the maps that is compact 
enough to allow the storage of many maps on a Compact Flash or MultiMedia card. 
For example, the map of Los Angeles county takes about 10 Mbytes of flash space. 
RoadMap comes with a set of tools to convert the US Census bureau data (the 2000 
and 2002 versions) into its own map format. 
<P>RoadMap is distributed with the map of San Francisco as an example. Other 
maps will be made available as soon as I can identify a public web site that is 
willing to accept them (these maps take some significant disk space). 
<P>Clicking on the map screen displays the name of the closest street, road or 
freeway (if any). On the iPAQ the "calendar" button is used to zoom in, the 
"telephone" button is used to zoom out, the arrow buttons are used to move the 
map and the Compaq ("menu") button is used as "quit". The other features are 
(IMHO) quite obvious. 
<P>When entering a street name, the street prefix, suffix and type, if provided, 
must be among the abbreviations listed by the US Census Bureau (N for north, E 
for east, Blvd for boulevard, etc..). In almost all cases these conventions 
follow the usual abbreviations, so there is no need to worry here. In addition, 
any of these fields is optional: not providing them only makes the search less 
selective. If several matches are found, RoadMap shows a list of all matching 
streets and lets the user select the appropriate one. 
<P>The exact format of the data expected by RoadMap as a complete street name is 
as follow: 
<P>
<CENTER>[<I>prefix</I> ' '] <I>name</I> [[' ' <I>suffix</I>] ' ' 
<I>type</I>]</CENTER>
<P>It is also possible to omit the street number, or to search around a given 
city (prefix the city name with character '?'). These options have the effect of 
making the search broader. 
<P>More information is available in the README file distributed with the sources 
and binaries.
