<P>
For many years, the RoadMap mailing list was hosted at saignon.net.  We
thank the folks there for this service.
<P>
For various reasons, as of October 2007 it has become more practical
to host the list at SourceForge.  Unfortunately, there are currently
no public archives of the older mailing list.

Click here</a> to subscribe to the "roadmap-general" general
discussion list, hosted at SourceForge.net.
<p>
Since the new list is at SourceForge, it
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=roadmap-general">has archives</a>.
<P>
There are currently no announce-only or developer-only lists.  This
may change in the future.
