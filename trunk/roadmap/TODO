RoadMap - a street navigation system using the US Census maps and GPS

Flexible tracking and waypoint handling

   As of today, RoadMap can track one GPS source and memorize two predefined
   waypoints (a position and a destination).

   RoadMap should allow the user to define as many waypoints as he wants. It
   should also make it possible to track as many GPS sources as defined by
   the user.

Submaps & Plugins

   The RoadMap format is flexible (additional tables could be added), except
   for that fact that it is monolythic: one single file per county, no plugins
   to handle additional tables that not originally planned in RoadMap.

   The result is that one must decide what is visible when generating the
   1.7 Gbyte map set. Any change means regenerating the whole thing. This
   is not friendly..

   In addition, when zooming out to display several states, the RoadMap
   performances go down in a linear fashion, until the Linux disk cache
   is saturated. Then the performances are disk-bound (and dismal..).

   The goal is to remove any hardcoded knowledge of line categories (street,
   freeway, shore, river, lake, etc..), to make the code able to gather lines
   from various extension map files and to allow the creation of plugins to
   handle new kind of map tables.

   This would also allow the physical isolation of features according to
   their declutter level (for example one extension file type for freeways
   and borders--load all the US freeway without taking too much space or
   even saturating the disk cache).

   Plugins should be flexible enough to allow for the gathering of data
   from other sources (database, web servers, etc..). This would allow for
   the mix of permanent features (roads, rivers, lakes, etc..) and dynamic
   information (traffic jams ? :-).

Address book:

   Add an interface with a plugin program to gather addresses from an existing
   address database. Make it a separate plugin to allow for the support of
   different database formats (selectable as a preference).

   The address database planned for support in the future is the one from
   the GPE project.

Routing:

   Make a plugin program to compute a route from the current location to the
   selected destination. make it a separate plugin to (1) keep the UI active
   while the route is selected, (2) not loose everything if the route program
   crashes or loop forever, and (3) allow people to implement their own
   (I guess there will be a lot of arbitrary choices to be made there).

Map Selection & Download:

   Make a graphical tool to select and load on the PDA the subset of maps
   required for a given trip. The idea is to first select counties using
   city & state names, and then graphically select/deselect surrounding
   counties using mouse clicks. The files representing the list of selected 
   counties is then being downloaded onto the selected pda/computer (one
   widget for selecting the pda, one button to start the download).

   The download part would be made using HTTP, downloading maps compressed
   using gzip. This way a standard web server can be used to serve maps.
   The roadmap preferences should allow for a list of URLs, so that one might
   imagine using one server for each section of the USA.

   There is the need for the following user interface:

   1- a dialog to select one county using a city/state combination.
   2- preferences editor: enter the list of URLs for downloading maps.
   3- a county limits map to select or remove counties graphically.
