/**
 * @file
 * @brief define functions that work on lines
 *
 * Lines have two endpoints, nothing in between.
 *
 * A line A-B should not be in a RoadMap map if it is a street that
 * intersects with street C-D.
 *
 *     A ---- C ------ B
 *            |
 *           /
 *         D
 * In this case, A-B should not be a line in the map, but A-C, C-B and
 * C-D should be.
 *
 * There are two higher level concepts also in RoadMap : streets and shapes.
 *
 * A street is something you'll recognize in real life :  it has a
 * name, and consists of some pieces that aren't even always adjacent.
 *
 * A shape is a RoadMap concept to represent the curves followed by a
 * non-straight line.
 *
 * Lines are basic elements for navigation :  they're interesting
 * because we know there's nothing between the two endpoints.
