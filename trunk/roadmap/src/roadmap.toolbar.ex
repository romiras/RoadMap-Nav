#
# Sample replacement toolbar for RoadMap.
#
# One button will invoke the menu system as a series of popups, and
# the other buttons will perform specific actions.  The button labels will
# come from "roadmap.actionlabels".
# If a "Menus..." button like that below is to be used, it may be
# desireable to suppress the default "normal" menus.  To do so, create
# an empty "roadmap.menus" file.
