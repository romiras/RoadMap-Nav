/**
 * @file
 * @brief roadmap_io.h - a unique interface to all types of IO
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *   This module provides a unique interface to all types of IO
 *   supported by RoadMap. It is not assumed that the OS provides
 *   a unified API for all sort of IO, thus this module that makes
 *   sure the rest of RoadMap code does not care much about these
 *   details.
 *   The IO must still be open in a IO specific way.
