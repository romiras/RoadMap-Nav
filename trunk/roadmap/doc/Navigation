RoadMap Navigation

April 2009



= RoadMap Navigation =

 Navigation support is work in progress.

 It requires maps that have been built with a new version of buildmap 
 (or buildmap_osm) because this new version will add a couple of tables
 to the map.

 Navigation support needs to be compiled in, see "Building". RoadMap will
 show an additional menu labelled "Navigate" when this code is compiled in.




 - Building RoadMap with Navigation Support

   Set USE_NAVIGATE_PLUGIN = yes in config.mk and run "make".

   The Makefile dependency rules should cause a recompile of the right files.
   If that doesn't happen, please rebuild the dependencies with
   "make depends".


 - Use of RoadMap Navigation

   Use one of the new buttons in the Trip -> Places -> Personal Landmarks
   dialog to specify both Departure and Destination.
   Then say Navigate -> Navigate.

   A dialog should then appear saying how far you'll travel, and how much
   time it'll take to travel there. The route is also drawn.

   On my Linux PC, calculating the route is almost instantaneous for short
   trips, on my PDA it takes a bit longer.

   The next step isn't there yet (working on that) : RoadMap should do
   sensible things when it notices that you're following the route.

   Also route calculation isn't what it should be, I need to look at the
   algorithm, it makes the strangest moves :-)


= Maps for Navigation =

  In order to support navigation, several extensions were made to the
  RoadMap map format :

  - Line By Point table

    This allows you to query which lines start or end at a given point.

  - Turn restriction table

    This allows you to specify that some turns aren't allowed.

  - Oneway street and layer table

    This table has an indication whether a street is "oneway" only, and
    it also stores the layer (type of street). The layer info was in
    another map table already (RoadMap used it) but it was stored in a
    way which made access to it slow.

  All of these additions are exactly that : there's more info in the maps,
  but the existing tables aren't changed in any way.

  This means that old maps still work for RoadMap, just don't try to use
  navigation with them.

  Both buildmap (Tiger) and buildmap_osm (OpenStreetMap) have been extended,
  both kinds of maps will support navigation.

  You'll find that the maps are substantially bigger than before.
  The line by point tables can use another round of space optimisation,
  this awaits understanding of the hashing.
