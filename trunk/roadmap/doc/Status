= New Release 1.2.0 =

    RoadMap has another new release.  It's been over a year
    since 1.1.0 was released.  Lots of work has been done since
    then, both in terms of features, and platform support.

    Major new developments in 1.2.0 include;

        - Support for OpenStreetMap maps, both geographically-based
          (i.e., arbitrary rectangular tiles) and political (i.e.,
          country-based).  The ability to use OSM maps moves RoadMap
          from being a highly US-centric program to one which can
          be useful worldwide.

        - Resurrection of the Windows CE port.  Since the port is
          supported via cross-compilation with ming32w, maintenance
          is much easier for the developers.

        - Initial support of the iPhone.
        


    There's more detail in the changelog.

= Two Branches =

    Not much progress has been made in merging code from the forked
    "roadmap_editor" branch, but some work has been ongoing.
    (Managed by Ehud Shabtai "roadmap_editor" has
    added the ability to create and edit maps, and to upload the
    results to a central postgres database.  Since the maps as
    created can contain the meta-data needed for successful
    auto-navigation, that feature has been added to the
    roadmap_editor branch as well.  This codebase is being used
    very successfully in the FreeMap Israel project.

= Help Wanted! =

    If you know something about GIS and want to help with the
    conversion of new map sources, or are just a good coder who
    wants better open-source mapping capabilities, please join
    the list and we'll figure out how you can help!
